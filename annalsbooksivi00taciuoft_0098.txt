TACITUS.

[Boox Ι.

tiosa largitio; seu nihil militi sive omnia concedentur, in ·

ancipiti res publica.

Igitur volutatis inter se rationibus placitum ut epistu-
lae nomine principis scriberentur: missionem dari vicena
stipendia meritis ; exauctorari qui sena den'a fecissent ac
retineri sub vexillo ceterorum immunes nisi propulsandi
hostis ; legata quae petiverant exsolvi duplicarique.

37 Sensit miles in tempus conficta statimque flagitavit.

Missio per tribunos maturatur, largitio differebatur in

simanique donec isdem in aestivis contracta ex viatico „

amicorum ipsiusque Caesaris pecunia persolveretur.

3. concedentur: see App. Ι.

4. volutatis: the same figure as in
the English turn over in one's mind.

stipendia . . . meritis: stipen-
dium mereri (lit. to earn pay) was
to serve a full campaign3 this means,
therefore, to those wlzo had served
twenty years.

exauctorari: this differed from
the full discharge (missionem)
given to those who had served twenty
years, in that those who received it
were· still held to service as vexilla-
rii (see note on tricena, 17. 3) ;⁴ as
this obligation had formerly been
imposed on those who had served
the full twenty years, the present
demand was really a shortening of
the service by four years.

ceterorum, all other duties .· neu-
ter, limiting immunes: it would
seem that the veterans had, by an
abuse, been subjected to the same
obligations as other soldiers.

duplicari: Suetonius says (Tib.
48) that this was the only donation
given by Tiberius to the soldiers
except after the fall of Sejanus.

The frugal disposition of Tiberius .
was undoubtedly often carried to
the extent of parsimony and even
niggardliness, and this was a lead-

several occasions, however, he ’

showed a prompt and wise liberal- . ἶ

37. in tempus, for the emer·
gency. Cf. ad tempus, 1. 2 n.

tribunos: these Officers had the
charge of all the details of military
administration in their legions.

2. quintani, etc.: these two le-
gions began the mutiny: see 31. 3.
They were led to winter quarters to
Vetera, Xanten, sixty miles below
Cologne; the first and twentieth to
Cologne itself.

aestivis: see note, 16. 2.

contracta, got together. ,

3. turpi agmine, a shamesul
march .· explained by de imperatore
rapti.

fisci: the baskets in which the
money was carried: the word was
used for the emperor’s special treas-
