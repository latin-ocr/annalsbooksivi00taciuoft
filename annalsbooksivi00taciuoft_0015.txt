woRKs OF TACITUS. xi

Augusti, serving as an introduction to the ffistories, in the
author's most mature style, and generally regarded as his mas-
terpiece. It was in sixteen books, of which about one—third,
the central portion of the work, is lost.

s It may be estimated roughly that about one-third of the
writings of Tacitus is extant.

4. The reputation of Tacitus during his own lifetime, both
as an historian and an orator, was very high. Pliny says of him
(ΙΙ. 11, 17) that, when engaged in the prosecution of a cruel
and unjust governor, he spoke eloquentissime et, quod eximium
orationi eius inest, σεμνῶς, which last word we may render,
‘in a stately, earnest style.' Again, in mentioning Tacitus as
delivering the funeral oration at the death of the distinguished
Verginius Rufus, he says (ΙΙ. 1) : lzic supremus felicitatz eius
cumulus accessit, laudator eloquentissimus. In another letter
(IX. 23) he tells of a conversation held by Tacitus with a
chance acquaintance, who asked him after some talk on literary
subJects‚ Tacitus es an Plz‘nz’us?—a coupling of names which
delighted Pliny exceedingly. But during the Middle Ages the
name of Tacitus fell into oblivion, and his works seemed entirely
lost. In the revival of learning some portions of his writings
were rescued. In November, 1425, the distinguished scholar
and discoverer of manuscripts, Poggio Bracciolini, received a
letter from Germany in which was mentioned the discovery of
aliqua opera Cornelii Taciti nobis ignota. But much corre-
spondence and inquiry failed to bring the book, and Poggio
died in 1459 without sight of the much desired treasure. Soon
after, however, the manuscript, containing the Dialogus, the
Germania, and a work of Suetonius, was brought to Italy. The
Agricola was discovered at about the same time ,- but the origi—
nal manuscripts disappeared shortly after being copied, so that
of these smaller works of Tacitus we have nothing but fifteenth

have been used by itself through a misunderstanding. It may be noted
that Tacitus himself (IV. 32, 1) speaks of the work as annales.
