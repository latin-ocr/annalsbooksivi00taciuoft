Egressus dein senatu vitam abstinentia finivit. Li-

5. vitam abstinentia finivit:
this is described by Seneca, Conso-
latio ad Marciam, 22. 6 (Marcia
was his daughter, whom he kept
in ignorance of his design): in
cubiculum se quasi gustaturus con-
tulit et dimissis pueris quaedam per
fenestram, ut videretur edisse, proie-
cit. A cena deinde, quasi iam satis
in cubiculo edisset, abstinuit. Altero
quoque die et tertio idem ficit.
Quartus ip5a infirmitate corporis
faciebat indicium. Complexus ita-
que te: “Carissima‚’' inquit, “filia,
et hoc unum tota celata vita, iter
mortis ingressus sum, et iam me-
dium fere teneo. Revocare me nec
debes nec potes.” Atque ita iussit
lumen omne praecludi et se in tene·
bras condidit. His daughter after-
wards published his writings.

6. auctoritas, influence.

36. continuus, uninterrupted‚·
i.e. even by this solemn festival.

feriarum Latinarum: a movable
festival (feriae conceptivae)‚ ap-
pointed directly after the new con-
suls entered upon their office, and
generally celebrated in the spring.
It was held upon the Alban Mount‚
at this period for four dayS.

praefectum urbis: under the
kings and in the early republic the
chief magistrate appointed a prae-

jectus urbis to administer in his ab· Δ ”

sence, whenever he was absent from
the city for more than one day.
After the establishment of the office
of praetor, that of praefect was no

longer necessary, except on the oc- * ⁴

casion of the Latin F estival, which
all magistrates were required to at-
tend. The office became, therefore,
a mere form, being filled by young
rnen below the senatorial age, and
with the understanding that no busi-
ness ofimportance should be brought
before them; hence the irregularity
of this prosecution. This officer was
distinguished from the regular city
praefect by the title praefectus urbi
seriarum Latinarum causa.
auspicandi: the duty of every
magistrate on assuming office. The
auspices were regularly taken upon
the Arx, or northern summit of the
Capitoline3 the tribunal employed
on this occasion was that which he
was entitled to use by virtue of his
office.
