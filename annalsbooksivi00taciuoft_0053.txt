mal acts by which Tiberius was des-
ignated as successor to the throne.
He was adopted A.D 4, after the

’ death of Gaius, on which occasion

he appears to have laid aside his
gentile name (Claudius), as was reg-

” ulai-ly done by the early emperors.
His dignity as crown prince is, like
-. that of the emperor himself, summed

up in his association in‘the procon-

sular and tribunician powers. The

potestas tribunicia was granted to

twenty-seven years of age; he and
Germanicus were now legally broth-
