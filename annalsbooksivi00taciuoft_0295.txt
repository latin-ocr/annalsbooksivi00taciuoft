Praeceperant animis orationem patres, quo quaesitior 57

adulatio fuit.

Nec tamen repertum nisi ut effigies prin· 2

cipum, aras deum, templa et arcus aliaque solita cen-
serent, nisi quod M. Silanus ex contumelia consulatus
honorem principibus petivit dixitque pro sententia, ut
publicis privatisve monumentis ad memoriam temporum
non consulum nomina praescriberentur, sed eorum qui

tribuniciam potestatem gererent.

At Q. Haterius cum 3

eius diei senatus consulta aureis litteris figenda in curia
censuisset, deridiculo fuit senex foedissimae adulationis

tantum infamia usurus,

8. bis consulem: A.D. 15 and 21.
57. praeceperant, anticipated.
quaesitior, more studied.

2. nec repertum: they had al-
ready, in their servility, exhausted
all forms of adulation.

principum : Tiberius and Drusus.

honorem : i.e. that which follows.

pro sententia, in support os lzz's
proposition.

ut publicis, etc.: every year was
denoted by the names of the con-
suls, according to the usage of the
republic; the method proposed
would mark them by the year of
the reign of the prince, asin modern
monarchies. Augustus seems to have
had some such plan in mind, when
he began to reckon the years of his

empne, this method of designating
the years failed to supersede that
by §onsuls (Momm. Rom. St. ΙΙ.

3. senex: he was too old to gain

anything but discredit by his propo-
sition; adulationis limits infamia,
and the participle usurus may be
rendered by a relative clause,—wlzo
wouldgaz'n, etc. (I. 13. 2 n.). Hate-‘
rius was now about eighty years old.

58. Iunio Blaeso: see 35.

ut . . . haberet: see 32.

frustra vulgatum, an unfhunded
notion‚· the flamens were priests of
special deities, fifteen in number, of
which the three here mentioned,—
of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus,—
called flamines maiores, were re-
quired to be patricians. They en-
joyed peculiar sanctity and privileges,
and were at the same time subject
to certain strict regulations‚ which
were, however, relaxed, except in
the case of the flamen of Jupiter,
who continued subject to a multi-
tude of petty restrictions‚ among
them noctem unam extra urbem
manere nefas (Liv. V. 52. 13); also
that he could not touch or even
name a goat, or uncooked meat, or

ivy, or beans (Gell. X. 15).
