pretes impulit, dum proavum Pompeium, amitam Scribo-
niam, quae quondam Augusti coniunx fuerat, conso-
brinos Caesares, plenam imaginibus domurn ostentat,
hortaturque ad luxum et aes-alienum, socius libidinum
et necessitatum, quo pluribus indiciis illigaret. .
Ut satis testium et qui servi eadem noscerent rep—
perit, aditum ad principem postulat, demonstrato crim-

Atque

interim Libonem ornat praetura, convictibus adhibet, non
vultu alienatus, non verbis commotior, ——adeo iram con-

consobrinos Caesares: Gaius
and Lucius, grandsons of Augustus.
This near ’kinship to the imperial
family, in the absence of a fixed rule
of succession‚ appears to have in-
spired Libo with a dangerous am-
bition. The case was very similar
to that of the Duke of Buckingham
and other members of the royal
family, whom Henry VIII. caused
to be beheaded. (See Bailey, Suc-
cession to tlte English Crown, p. 106
seq.). But Libo appears to have
gone a step further than Bucking-
ham or Surrey.

plenam imaginibus domum.
the ius imaginum, or right of
having waxen masks‚ representing
distinguished members of the family,
which were kept in the atrium, and
carried in funeral processions, was
the distinguishing mark of nobility3
it established the pedigree.
· socius necessitatum: i.e. help-
ing to borrow money for him. For a
different use of necessitas, see I. 1 1. 6.

28. noscerent, would acknowl-
ecssre.

repperit: i.e. Catus.

eadem: i.e. the alleged crimes.

Flaccum Vescularium: for his
death, see VI. 10. 2.

cui . . . erat: we see the begin-
nings of a court in the modern
sense, in this requirement of an in-
termediary. See lnge, Society in
Rome under tlze Caesars, p. 1 19.

2. congressus: i.e. with Catus.

commeare, be carried on, by
message. '

3. interim: Suetonius says (Tib.
25) that he waited two years before
bringing the matter to a head, but
that in the meantime he was con-
stantly on his guard against assassi-
nation: inter pontifices sacrificanti
pro secespita plumbeum cultrum
subiciendum curavit, et secretum
petenti nonnisi acffiibito Druso filio
dedit, dextramque obambulantis,
veluti incumbens, quoad perageretur
sermo, continuit. Suetonius, it may
be added, represents Libo as unques-
tionably guilty, —res novas clam
moliebatur,—-and his guilt appears
clearly enough from the account of
Tacitus. Velleius (II. 129) repre-
sents the action of the emperor as
very prompt,—quam celeriter in-
gratum et nova molientem oppressit!
