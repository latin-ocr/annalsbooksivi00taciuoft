TACITUS.

Varianis legionibus structum et veterem aram Druso
4 sitam disiecerant. Restituit aram honorique patris prin-
ceps ipse cum legionibus decucurrit; tumulum 'iterare
5 haud visum. Et cuncta inter castellum Alisonem ac
Rhenum novis limitibus aggeribusque permunita.
Iamque classis advenerat cum, praemisso commeatu
et distributis in legiones ac socios navibuS, fossam cui
Drusianae nomen ingreSSUS, precatusque Drusum pa-
trem ut se eadem ausum libens placatusque exemplo ac

tione pervehitur.

altar need not have been on the
same spot, but in the neighborhood.

legionibus, Druso: datives, not
of agency, but of interest.

sitam: the use of this word, as
equivalent to conditam, is peculiar
to Tacitus.

4. decucurrit: the decursio was
a solemn march three times round
the altar 3 see Verg. Aen. XI. 188.

haud visum: Furneaux thinks
because it was too distant for him
to visit. The natural interpretation
of the passage, however, especially
with the pluperfect‚ disiecerant
(i.e. before they dilapsi sunt), is
that both altar and mound wer
near the fort. >

5. Alisonem: a fortress estab-
lished by Drusus, at the junction of
the Aliso with the Lippe. It is dis-
puted whether the name is to be
recognized in that of the town of
Alsen, near Paderborn, or of the
river Alzse, which flows into the
Lippe at Hamm. 'Ibe situation at
Hamm, upon the middle course of
the Lippe, equally near the Cherusci
and the Bructeri, is much the most
probable. Moreover‚ it would be
quite practicable to construet de-
fences connecting this point with

Classis Amisiae relicta laevo amne,

the Rhine (cuncta inter castellum
Alisonem ac Rhenum), while to
do this with a place so distant as
Alsen would be difficult, and, in
the present hostile relations-with
these tribes, practieally impossible.
As this fort was constructed by
Drusus, it is probable that his altar
was near to it‚-an argument for
regarding this as the fort mentioned
at the beginning of the chapter.

limitibus, defl’nsz've works (see
1. 50. 2 n.) ; aggeribus, 'cause-
ways.

8. advenerat: i.e. at the ap-
pointed place (6. 4).

praemisso: to the Ems.

fossam: this connects the Rhine
with the Yssel, thus *giving a pas-
sage into Lake Flevo. Suetonius
(Claud. 1) says of Drusus, fossas
novi et immensi operis qffecz't, quae
nunc adhuc Drusinae vocantur.

lacus: the series of small lakes
and lagoons, part of which are now
united in the Zuyder Zee.

2. Amisiae: to be construed
with laevo amne, on the left bank
(i.e. the side towards Gaul). It is
taken as a locative by some; but
although Ptolemy mentions a place
called Ἀμάσεια, Tacitus would have
