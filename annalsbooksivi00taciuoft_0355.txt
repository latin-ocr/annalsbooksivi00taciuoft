Tunc tractatae Massiliensium preces 7

Vulcatius Moschus exsul in Massilienses receptus bona
sua rei publicae eorum ut patriae reliquerat.

nae opes innocenter partae et modeste habitae. Domi· 2

cui minor Antonia, Octavia genita, in matrimonium

laeta Tiberio ε because the Julian

’ tace, to which he belonged by adop-

tion, professed to be descended from
Iulus, son of AEneas; this made him
consanguineus.

7. preces: explained by what
follows. The will of Moschus had
been contested on the ground that
he could not thus expatriate himself ;
but it was sustained by the prece-

- dent of Rutilius (ΙΙΙ. 66. 2), who,

under similar circumstances, had
become a citizen of Smyrna.

8. Massilienses: this rich and
populous commercial city, although
deprived of most of its territory by
Julius Caesar, B.C. 49, still, like
Rhodes (Ι. 4. ‚4 n.)‚ retained its in-
dependence‚ as a civitas foederata
(Plin. N. Η. ΙΙΙ. 4. 35), and pos·
sessed therefore the ius exsilii, or
right of receiving exiled Roman
citizens,

44. Cn. Lentulus: see Ι. 27. 1.
The Getae, whom he subdued, were
a Thracian people residing upon

both banks of the Danube, proba-
bly identical with the Dacians.

L. Domitius: grandfather of the
emperor Nero. His grandfather,
Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, fell
at Pharsalus on the side of Pompey
(pro optimatibus); he was, says
Suetonius (Nero, 2), vir neque satis
constans et ingenio truci, and adds
that he favored treating neutrals as
enemies.

gloriae: dative of service.

2. misceretur, joined.

pater civili bello maris potens:
this son Gnaeus, whom Suetonius
(Nero, 3) pronounces omnibus gen-
tis suae procul dubio praeferendum,
commanded the republican fleet,
under Brutus and Cassius, and after
the downfall of his party, delivered
it up to Antony, receiving therefor
pardon, and retaining his property;
he afterwards went over to Octa·
vius. He is the Enobarbus of
Shakespeare.
