mind of Tiberius, I. 47. 13 ut quibusque bellum invitis aut

t. Many words are used only by Tacitus, and others only by
him in a certain meaning, eg. finire, die, VI. 50. 9 ; inturbidus,
undistarbed, III. 52. 1 ς circumflui, surrounded by, VI. 37. 4.

As the style of Tacitus exaggerates all the characteristics of
the Latinity of the Silver Age, so his style in the Annals, his
latest work, pushes his own peculiarities to their extreme. It
is in this work that his harshness and crabbedness of style are
found in their fullest development. Some sentences seem like
mere strings of disconnected words, the relation of which to
one another can only be discovered by assiduous study and
analysis. The Annals stands to the Dialogus, in respect to
style, very much as Carlyle's Frederick the Great to his Life of
Sterling.
