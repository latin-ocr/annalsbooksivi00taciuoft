Υ Nec ultra deliberatum quo minuS, non quidem extrema 2
,decemerent (id enirn vetitum), sed paratos ad ultionem

2. deliberatum: taken as a verb

ἶ of hindering, and thus· followed by
¹ quo minus, there was no further

ς hesitation in, etc.

extrema: zze. punishment.
paratos, etc.: to give the im-
pression that the senate was eager

1 to punish, but was restrained by the
’ emperor's interposition.

There is at this point no gap in

{l ’ vi principis impediri testarentur.

it is evident that the copyist by some
blunder passed over several pages.
All recent editors agree that the
six chapters which follow, formerly
regarded as a part of Book V..
really belong to Book VI. The his-
tory of the intervening period can
be partly reconstructed from the
account of Dio Cassius, a translation
of which, together with passages of

the manuscript, but, as the history

⁷, Juvenal and Suetonius bearing on
of more than two years is omitted,

the same events, is here inserted.

··- birthday should be celebrated as a public holiday; and it would not be

, over, were sent both to him and to Tiberius by the senate on its own
,ζ’ g account, and the knights on their own account, and the people, as repre-
ἦ sented both by the tribunes and the aediles; and prayers and sacrifices
ἐζ ,τετε offered for both alike‚ and oaths were sworn by the fortune of each.

’ἶ 3. Now Tiberius seized a favorable opportunity to attack Gallus, who
’ ² had married his divorced wife,1 and had used too great freedom of speech
about the government. He had, it is true, paid court to Sejanus, either in
good faith, believing him destined to be emperor, or through fear of Tibe-
riuS, or through artifice, in order that Sejanus might by insolence lose
credit with the emperor ; and he had proposed numerous and great honors
to him, and had taken an active part in the embassies sent to him. But
now the emperor sent a missive to the senate, accusing Gallus, among other
things, of envy towards Sejanus on the ground of his friendship with him

age.
