not without expressions, at the same time, which showed that he
recognized in him dangerous elements of character. Tiberius
himself seems to have been fully aware of the presence of these
evil impulses in his nature, and shrank with what we have no
right to call an insincere reluctance from the assumption of
absolute power. And yet, during the fifteen years from his
accession to his retirement at Capri, it is hard to point out
a single act of his which was manifestly unjust and cruel. So
well was the worse side of his nature kept under by his better
qualities.

11. It is most unfortunate that we are left so much in the
dark as to the occurrences of the three eventful years described
in the lost chapters of the fifth and sixth books. All we can
say is, that when we return to the lucid and eloquent narrative
of the historian‚ the emperor seems like a different man. As
to the charges of extreme debauchery, they may be passed over ⁴
as unlikely or at least exaggerated. Such charges are generally
brought against persons who live a secluded life, especially when
they are unpopular for other reasons. But Ι (10 not see how it

in these last years. It is easy enough to explain away, as Stahr
does, individual instances, and to show that the list of known
victims, spread over the space of six years, does not after all
give a high average. But, after making all allowances‚ it seems
impossible to avoid the conclusion, from the detailed accounts
os the historians, and the incidental allusions of other writers,
that these six years were a veritable reign of terror. Nor is it
possible to vindicate the emperor by throwing the responsibility
upon his ministers and the senate. What an absolute ruler

significant. The punishment of Clutorius Priscus (III. 49)
and Cremutius Cordus (IV. 34) may be excused‚ and perhaps
justified ; but it is none the less true that from this time the
