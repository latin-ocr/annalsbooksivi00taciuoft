PERIODS IN HIS LIFE. xv

unsettle the moral nature of a young man 3 how is it with a man
of seventy? Professor Beesly puts the case forcibly and conclu‘
sively, as against the imputed change in the character of Tiberius
after assuming the purple at fifty-six, against the assumption of
Tacitus that a man egregius vita famaque, quoad privatus vel in
imperiis sub Augusto fuit, all at once became a hypocrite and a
tyrant. *“ I would put it to γοα, have you in your own experi-
ence found that men come out in an entirely new character
after fifty—six? ’' One can only say “no '’ to this question, for
at fifty-six Tiberius was still in the prime of his powers. But it

obscured in the eyes of superficial observers by these less
attractive characteristics‚ especially when they were contrasted
with the popular manners and sunny disposition of his brother
Drusus and nephew Germanicus. It may readily be believed
that the morbid tendencies of his nature were increased when,
on the command of Augustus, he was obliged to put away his
muchnloved wife Vipsania and marry the haughty and licen-
tious Julia‚ who disliked and despised him. In a fit of moody
impatience and disgust he withdrew from the court, and lived
in retirement several years at Rhodes 3 and this episode, too,
may well have developed still further the unamiable side of his
nature. And yet Augustus, alienated from him for a time,
recalled him to Rome, and designated him as his successor
