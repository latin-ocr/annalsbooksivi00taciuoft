adulescentulum, ne seditiosum exercitum pavescerent.

cinam cum quadraginta cohortibus Romanis distrahendo

Pedo praefectus finibus Frisiorum ducit.

adulescentulum: Germanicus
was really of about the same age as
Arminius, but might easily seem a
mere boyv to the war-worn hero of

*⁴ the Teutoburg Forest.

8. novas: i.e. which are new

« ’ things—contrasted with antiqua.

The contrast with patriam shows

that the colonies referred to are, like
that of the Ubii (Cologne), those
to which they might be removed on

’ · Roman soil, not such as the Romans

might found on German soil.
60. non modo . . . sed: the

omission of etiam is rare in Cicero,

³ but common in Livy and later
writers.

in partis, into tlte party ‚· a com-
mon expression.

vetere apud Romanos auctori-
tate,⁸ of lang-standing influence
with the Romans‚- i.e. before the

Ῑ ⁴· revolt of Arminius.

 

2. mole una: i.e. the concen-
tration of the entire force of the en-
emy3 see distrahendo hosti below.

quadraginta cohortibus Ro-
manis: an equivalent expression
for four entire legions. Germanicus
had the other four. From suum
militem, 63. 5, it appears that Cae·
cina had his own legions, but there
is no mention of auxiliaries.

Ipse imposi- 3

per Bructeros : they occupied the
territory between the Ems and the
Lippe, about the modern city of
Miinster. The route of Caecina prob-
ably avoided the highlands upon the
Lippe, as well as the centre of the
Bructerian territory, and reached
the Ems in the neighborhood of
Rheine, about 2 5 miles north of
Miinster, and nearly west of Osna-
burg: along this line the traces of a
Roman road have been discovered.

, (Knoke, p. 50.) At the same point

the cavalry under Pedo must have
struck the Ems, because below here
begin the marshes, which make the
river inaccessible from the west (id.

p. 53). Germanicus could easily
ἓξὲξ reached the same point in his

hosti: the Cherusci, against
whom the campaign was directed.

praefectus: sc. equiturn.

Pedo: probably the Pedo Albino-
vanus, mentioned by Seneca (Suas.
I. 15), as having composed a poem
upon the expeditions of Germani-
cus; a few lines of this poem are
given by Seneca. See II. 24. 6 n.

finibus: a local ablative3 by tlte
way os} etc.

Frisiorum: the Frisians, on the
coast of the North Sea, from the
