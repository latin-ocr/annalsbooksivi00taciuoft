consulatu functuS‚ Cocceius Nerva, cui legum peritia,
eques Romanus praeter Seianum ex illustribus Curtius

sisse Roma Tiberium, ut reditus illi negaretur. Unde
exitii causa multis fuit properum finem vitae coniectan-

casum providebant ut undecim per annos libens patria

gressurum haud forte dictum: ceterorum nescii egere,
cum propinquo rure aut litore et saepe moenia urbis as-

Cocceius Nerva: a distinguished

jurist, belonging to the school of

Labeo (see ΙΙΙ. 75. 2 n.), grandfather
of the emperor Nerva ; his death is
related VI. 26. 1. The selection by
Tiberius of a man of his unblem-
ished character and free principles
as his chief companion, goes a great
way to show that his object in se-
cluding himself was hot to indulge
in private debauchery. The com-
pany of those liberalibus studiis
praediti indicates that it was his
intention to spend the rest of his
life in the cultivation of literature.

ex illustribus: see II. 59. 4;
this class included also the younger

· members of senatorial families, who

had tnot yet been admitted to the
sena e.

2. periti caelestium, astrologers.
3. artis, genuine science,—the
prediction that he would never re-
turn was true (artis) ς· that he was
soon to die was guess-work (falsi).
quam: interrogative.

4. forte, at hap-hazard.

ceterorum: neuter.

egere, they were.

assidens, close to.

59. 2. Speluncae: the name is
preserved in the modern village of
Sperlonga.

mare Amunclanum, etc.: the
town of Fundi lay at the foot of the
mountains‚ at some distance from
the coast; Amunclae or Amyclae was
on the sea >at the nearest point to
Fundi. This whole region abounds
in natural caverns.
