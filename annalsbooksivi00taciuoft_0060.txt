the right os summoning the senate.
Tiberius therefore called the senate
together by virtue of his tribunician
power (see note on chap. 2); his

roconsular imperium did not give
him this right.

posuit : Intr.

⁵6. neque abscedere: he owed
this service to his adoptive father.

id: relates to de . . . eonsul-
turum; this duty he took upon
himself. .

7. signum: the military pass-
word.

ut imperator: having the pro-
consular imperium ,· see note to
filius, 3. 3.

cetera aulae, everytlzing else that
belongs· to a court.

8. cunctabundus, showing hesi-
tation.

loqueretur: for this subjunctive
of repeated action, common in the
post-classical writers ; see A. and G.

9. eausa praecipua: he wished
by this show of hesitation to force
the senate to a formal offer of the
throne ς armed with this legal au·

on account of the popularity or

military force of Germanicus. In· Ϊ

the meantime he promptly exercised

the powers which he already pos· '⁷

sessed. With the words nam Tibe·
rius Tacitus begins to describe the

hesitation and apparent reluctance s

of Tiberius to assume any new title
or power; he already having the
tribunician power and the impe-
rium. With sed defuneto, etc., he
shows that in spite of this hesita-
tion to assume new powers, he exer·
cised his old powers promptly and
vigorously, and thus was princeps
in all but name; the reason for
both is the sear of Germanicus.

tot legiones: see note to chap.
3. 5. These eight legions made about
40,ooo men, to whom must be added
fully as many auxiliaries.

exspectare: as adopted son and
successor; see 3. 5.

10. dabat et famae, lze lzad regard
ako, etc.; i.e. his dignity and reputa-
tion required that he should assume
the purple by a constitutional grant,
and not by an informal act, which
would have the look of usurpation.
