Ι. TEXTUAL N OTES.

BOOK Ι.

4. 4. aliquid: this is the manuscript reading, changed by most editors
to aliud. There are two objections to it: from its connection we should
expect quidquam, and it is also somewhat irregular (but quite in the style
of Tacitus) to have it followed by quam (some such word as potius being
understood). But the distinction between aliquis and quisquam was some·
what obscured in the later writers, just as the corresponding words some
and any are constantly confused by foreigners. A good example is Tac.
Dial. 343 ubi nemo impune stulte aliquid aut contrarie dicit, where no

’ · one without detection says anytlzing Jbolisli or inconsistent. Drager (Hist.

 

Syntax‚ 12. 91) cites two examples from Lactantius, where the two words
are used as identical: IV. 3. 8, nec tamen moveat quemquam ‚· ΙΙ. 8. 37,
nec tamen commoveat aliquem. There are even instances of this confusion
in the classical period (CaeS. B. C. III. 71, sine ullo vulnere‚· III. 73, sine
aliquo vulnere). See Madvig on Cic. a'e Fin. II. 27. 87.

8. 3. urbanis quingenos: supplied from Suet. Oct. 101 and Dio, LVI.
32. It is more probable that the omission was due to a scribe's oversight
than that Tacitus was ignorant of the fact or, knowing it, failed to state it.

4. insignes: in the manuscript this word is followed by visi [sc. sunt]‚
and some editors insert qui as its subject, before insignes. The reading
here given is supported by 77. 5, multa decernuntur, ex quis maxime in·
signia ne, etc.

10. 4. Vedii Pollionis: this is Mommsen’s reading. The manuscript
reads nuberetque tedii et vedii pollionis .· but nothing is known of any
Tedius to whom this would apply, and the similarity of the names makes it
easy to suspect an error.

28. 2. quae pergerent: most editors change to qua, on the ground
that pergo cannot govern the accusative, except one of cognate meaning, as
pergere iter. Bo'tticher (Lex. Tac. p. 10) suggests that pergo, like por-
rigo, arrigo, etc„ from reg0‚ may properly retain the regimen of the simple
verb ; or quae may depend on an implied agere ; cf. Plaut. Men. 752,
pariter hoc atque alias res soles. At any rate the objection does not seem
to justify altering the manuscript reading.
