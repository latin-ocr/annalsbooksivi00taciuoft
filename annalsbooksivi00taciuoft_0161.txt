measures at the same time to have
him privately assassinated. As Taci-
tus evidently believed (see Intr. 7)
that the death of Germanicus, which
followed very shortly (72. 2), was
the effect of poison, administered by
Piso, at the instigation of Tiberius,
— an assertion which is repeated by
most modern historians,—we have
a right to assume that he has given
us all the evidence upon which the

’ story rests, and it will easily appear

from the following narrative that
there is absolutely no evidence, even
circumstantial‚ in its favor. In the
present chapter the only fact of im-
portance is the transfer of Germani-
cus from one important command
to another. This was connected
with a change of policy, the em-
peror finally deciding to give up all
efforts to recover possession of Ger-
many, and simply maintain the fron-
tier of the Rhine. That he feared
the popularity of Germanicus, and
was glad of a pretext to change his

command, is not unlikely; it has
been a not unusual policy in all
ages.

novis provinciis: see 43. 2, pro-
vinciae quae mari dividuntur.

enee to his future operations.

proeliorum vias z the route,
whether by land or water. He had
tried both ways the year before, and
now decided for the water.

quae evenissent: z'.e. the expe-
rience of his past campaigns, ex-
plained in fundi . . . iniquum.

3. iustis: z'.e. suited for regular
operations.

iuvari, etc.: contrasted with fun·
di . . . locis.

damno: see I. 71. 3.

ministrandis equis: these had
been freely offered (I. 71. 3); but
the loyalty of the Gauls must not
be tried too severely.

4. possessionem: has here an
active sense; taking into posses-
szon.

maturius: the expedition could
be made by water earlier than land
forces would find the ground fit for

marching.
