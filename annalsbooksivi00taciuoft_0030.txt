xxvi INTRODUCTION.

civil jurisdiction, the urbanus and peregrinus, continued for a
while to perform the same functions; the others attended to
financial matters, or presided over the games. It was impor-
tant that the magistracies should be regularly filled in order
that there might be a sufficient number of consulares and
praetorii to hold proconsulships and other offices held only by
persons of this rank. But all the magistracies became more
and more merely formal and nominal. Tiberius is more than
once spoken of by Mommsen as the one who brought the
monarchy to completion-—der Vellender der Monarchz'e. He
received as a perpetual grant the imperium which Augustus

and operation of nature 3 which regarded the entrance upon
the future life as the assumption of a divine nature (see Cic.
Cat. Mai. 22, 81). Great and noble souls were by this acqui-
sition of divinity placed directly among the greater gods, under
the title of demigods and heroes ε so it was with Hercules and
with Romulus (Hor. Oa'. III. 3), and with Julius Caesar, to
whom a temple was erected immediately after his death. As
this was not a change of nature, but only the passage into a
new phase of life, it was not hard to accept the beneficent
ruler while living upon the earth as a present god -— deus, deus
ille? Menalca! And as the native religion of Rome had now
