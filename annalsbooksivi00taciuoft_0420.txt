Suetonius further tells us that this
measure also was initiated by the
emperor; see next note. It would
seem that in granting the eighteen
months' respite he at the same time
recommended this measure for im-
mediate relies.

duas quisque, etc.: this meas-
ure, hard to understand as here de·
scribed, is made clear by Suetonius,
whose description of the transaction
is as follows: cum per senatus con-
sultum sanxisset ut faeneratores
a'uas patrimonii partes in solo collo-
carent, debitores totidem aeris alieni
statim solverent, nec res expediretur.
He uses the word patrimonium
(estate) inexactly, where Tacitus
uses faenus (principal). His state-
ment— that the debtors were to
pay two-thirds‚ and the creditors to
invest it in land—must be under-
stood to mean that the creditors
were to take land in payment.
Trajan likewise (Plin. Epp. VI. 19.
4) ordered candidates patrimonii
tertiam partem conferre in ea quae
solo continerentur.

in solidum, inficll.

decorum· it was no legal ob·
ligation, but to refuse to pay would
impair their credit. Or possibly
the adjustment described above was

TACITUS.

[Boox VI.

Ita primo concur·

recommended rather than ‘pre-
scribed.

3. concursatio: i.e. to the credi·
tors.

strepere, to resound with law-
suits. ,

venditio et emptio: reciprocal
terms expressing the two sides of Ὢ
the same act —purclzase and sale
of property.

faeneratores . . . condiderantt
the capitalists did not purchase land ⁴.
at once, but kept the money on κζ
hand (condiderant) for the pur-
pose of buying, as favorable oppot· 5ss
tunities should offer. By this the
distress of the debtors was enhanced,
because the large capitalists held ofl ’“
in order to buy cheap. ..

condiderant: most editions ἶ·
place a full stop after this word, «ἵ
and a semicolon after provolve- ’
bantur-3 but it is evident that the
passage copiam. wprovolveban
tur is a part of the explanation of τ
in contrarium mutari, as follow·

   

ing quia. ’
4. distrahebant, sell in small
lats,- because the market was glutted.
per mensas: the amount of
about 85 ‚,000000 was deposited fot {f
the purpose of loans for three years ξ
without interest, but on the securityz.
