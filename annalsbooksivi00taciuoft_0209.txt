γ’ vgave ground for bringing her‘offence

under the charge of maiestas. This
interpretation had been given to the
law by Augustus, and is contained
even in the English law of treason of

’1 Edward III. But Tiberius rejected

the principle, by declaring that the
charge of adultery should be tried

Τ , by the Julian LaW, just as in the case

of other persons, while that of mai-

³ sJ estas should be limited to language

in disparagement of Augustus.
2. lege Iulia [de adulteriis et

ν ' stupris]: passed by Augustus, B.C.

17 ; it established fine and banish-
ment in place of the punishment by

j . ⁴ the husband, which had been al-
’ Ιοννεάνῦγ the old law. See below.

dis‘tingui: that the two charges
should be considered separately.

3. eius: of Tiberius.

secus: i.e. otherwise than was

true and fitting.

illius: his mother.

5. graviorem poenam depre-
catus: the punishment, by the
Julian Law, was deportation to an
island, and the confiscation of one-
third of the fortune and half of the
dowry, while the man lost half his
property; this he would commute
to banishment within Italy, with no
confiscation.

propinquis: dative of agent3
by a council of kinsmen, as in
ancient times.

Italia atque Africa: ablative of
separation with interdictum est.

51. subrogando: the prefix
sub, as in consul suffectus, indicates
an election to fill a vacancy.

2. propinquum Germanici: he
was grandson of Agrippa, and,
therefore, nephew of Agrippina,
wife of Germanicus. See note on
neptem, 50. 15 also I. 77. 3.
