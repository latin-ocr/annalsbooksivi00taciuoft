some distance inland, where they

have proceeded down the Rhine to
some point in the territory of the
Frisians (perhaps near Deventer)
from whence he could march east
to the Ems.

3. per lacus: the lagoons and
estuaries along the coast. The
Zuyder Zee was formed out of them
about six hundred years ago, by a

small sheets of water into a great
bay.

three bodies, under Caecina, Pedo,
and Germanicus, respectively, met
