dum audebat ad duriora vertere.

Druso Caesare C. Norbano consulibus decernitur

in aestatem summa ope· parabat, initio veris et repen-

Nam spes inces-

Arminius

turbator Germaniae; Segestes parari rebellionem saepe .
alias et supremo convivi0‚ post quod in arma itum, aperuit
suasitque Varo ut se et Arminium et ceteros proceres
vinciret: nihil ausuram plebem principibus amotiS, atque

misceri: reflexive; mingle him-
seffi take part in.

4. molliter habitum, humored.

55. Druso Caesare, ete.: the
consuls of the new year, A.D. 15. It
was usual at this period to have the
consuls hold office for only half a
year, the object being to increase
the number of those who were qual-
ified to hold certain offices reserved
for consulares,· eg the governorships
of Asia, Africa, Britain, etc. In the
reign of'Tiberius there was great
irregularity in this respect. Momm.
R‘o‘m. St. ΙΙ. 79. The first pair⁴ of
consuls for each year were epony-
mous, z‘.e. gave their name to the
year.

triumphus: this triumph was
celebrated two years later, A.D. 173
see II. 41. 2. To vote a triumph
before the conclusion of the war
(manente bello) was very unusual.

initio veris, etc.‚ in early spring,
by a sudden raid (involving a
change of plan). For this use of
et, cf. such phrases as multi et boni,
and 29. 1, orto die et vocata conti-
one.

Chattos: the modern Hessians,

dwelling south of the nations in· .

vaded the year before. This cam-

paign, like that against the Marsi · ’ ’

the year before, was only prelimi·

nary to the great expedition of the , .

present year against the Cherusci.

2. dissiderem, were ᾱιἫωιίειίιηίο - ³¹ ’

factions between.

Arminium, Hermann, the leader
of the Germans in the defeat of

Varus, A.D. 9. He had served in ’ ’

the Roman army, and received
Roman citizenship and equestrian
rank (Vell. II. 118).

aut: bad saith in one contrasted
with loyalty in the other; cf. 28.

quod: relates to convivium.

itum: sc. est.

suasit, advised.

proceres, nobles ,· principibus,

identical, but that the elected mag-
