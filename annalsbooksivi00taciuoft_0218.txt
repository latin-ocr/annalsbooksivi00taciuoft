provinciae praetendebatur, levavitque apertis horreis
pretia frugum multaque in vulgus grata usurpavit: sine
milite incedere, pedibus intectis et pari cum Graecis
amictu, P. Scipionis aemulatione, quem eadem factita-
visse apud Siciliam, quamvis flagrante adhuc Poenorum
beno, accepimus, Tiberius cultu habituque eius lenibus
verbis perstrictO, acerrime increpuit, quod contra insti-
tuta Augusti non sponte principis Alexandriam introis-
set. Nam Augustus inter alia dominationis arcana,
vetitis nisi permissu ingredi senatoribus aut equitibus
Romanis illustribus, seposuit Aegyptum, ne farne urge-
ret Italiam, quisquis eam provinciam claustraque terrae
ac maris quamvis levi praesidio adversum ingentes exer-
citus insedisset. Sed Germanicus nondum comperto
profectionem eam incusari Nilo subvehebatur, orsus

tis: a causal genitive, common in
Tacitus, rare in other writers (Intr.
35 n)

2. provinciae: Egypt was not
strictly a province (see 4 n, and
Intr. 18. B. iv).

horreis· the public granaries,—
an object of great importance in
Egypt, as illustrated in the story of
ose h.

J prletia frugum: Suetonius (Tib.
52) says that he went to Egypt
propter immensam et repentinam
amem.

sP. Scipionis aemulatione ε
Livy (XXIX. 19) says of Scipio,
cum pallio crepidisque inambulare
in gymnasio. The Greek pallium
was a square garment, the Roman
toga was long and with partly
rounded ends; both were worn in
nearly the same way, folded over
the shoulders and around the body.
Τ11ε κρηπίς was a sandal—pedibus
intectis, — while the Roman calceus
was a shoe, covering the foot.

3. sponte, consent,· properly used
with a possessive, in late writers
with a genitive.

4. illustribus: i. e. those equites - “

who had a senatorial fortune, one
million sesterces.

seposuit Aegyptum. Egypt was
never formally made into a province,
but was governed by the emperor
as a separate kingdom, always hav-
ing common equites as its governors.
It was, therefore, a serious offence
in Germanicus to visit it without
permission.

farne urgeret: Egypt was one
of the chief sources of the corn
supply for Italy, and must not be
exposed to the chauces of war and
revolution.

quisquis, whoever, pretender or
rebel; subject of urgeret.

claustra terrae ae maris: Alex-
andria and Pelusium, at the extreme
west and east, which could be easily
held adversum ingentes exer-
citus.
