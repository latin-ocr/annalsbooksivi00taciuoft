· rate was for the old year of ten
⁴ months, which would be ten per

ξ ι(ιεῐιῒ for the year of twelve months.

By the law presently referred to, it

rogatione tribunicia: this was

' lev-ggga· versura: probably by the

·· . not the taking interest at all, but
⁷ “ the trade of money-lending (faene-

5. tum, on the present occasion.

ea quaestio: the court which
had cognizance of this offence.

trepidi patres: in violating this
law the senators likewise offended
against the public sentiment which
forbade them to engage in trade.

concedente: Intr. 35 o.

secundum, etc.: i.e. arrange
their business so as to conform to
the laW.

commoto: i.e. being called in;
this made an enormous demand for
ready money, while the extensive
confiscations had locked up large
sums in the treasury.

2. ad hoc, to meet this emergency,
— an unusual meaning of this phrase,
but supported by the expression of
Suetonius who (Tib. 48), in de-
scribing the measures now taken,
adds: nec res expediretur ‚· from
which we understand that the
measure aimed to relieve from em-
barrassments, but failed, as we see
further on to have been the case.
