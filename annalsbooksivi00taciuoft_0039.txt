LANGUAGE AN D STYLE. mv

for concrete, or in the plural, thus turning them into concretes.
This is one of the usages which mark most distinctly the transi-
tion to modern turns of expression ; for one of the chief points
of difference between the ancients and moderns consists in the
choice of concrete and abstract forms of speech, e.g. nonanus,
sc. miles, tlze soldiers of the nintlz legion, I. 30. 43 matrimonia
ae pecunias hostium, the wives and moneys qf tlze enemy, II. 13.
33 qui infamias subiere, who underwent infamy [on different
occasions], IV. 33. 4.

Sometimes, on the other hand, Tacitus uses a concrete ex-
pression where we should expect an abstract3 eg. specie reeu-
santis, with a show of rejecting, Ι. 3. 2, where the participle
serves the purpose of a gerund.

b. The use of simple verbs where the prose writers em-
ployed compounds is especially characteristic of the Annaic.
The greater precision of the compounds fitted them for the
uses of prose speech, while the poets, whom Tacitus here imi-
tates, appear to have found a certain freedom and picturesque-
ness in the simple forms: eg. posuit for proposuit, put forth,
I. 7. 53 versa for eversa, overturned, II. 42. 4 3 firmabat for
confirmabat, strengthened, I. 71. 5.

Compound verbs are often used with an accusative where
the rule would require a preposition or a dative, eg. pugnam
aut vincula elapsi, having escapedfrom battle or prison, I. 61. 6.

c. Also borrowed from the poets is the frequent omission of
the copula. A characteristic illustration of this is found in the
second chapter of the first book, where postquam is followed by
arma [erant], oppressus [est] and reliquus [erat]

d. The construction of the partitive genitive is carried to a
great length, particularly as depending upon abstract nouns or
the neuter (usually plural) of adjectives used abstractly, and
even masculine and feminine adjectives 3 eg. uligines paludum,
marshy swamps, I. 17. 5 3 subiecta vallium, the valleys below, Ι.
65. 1 3 (but prominentia montium, the spurs of tlze mountaim,
II. 16. 2 3) tacita suspicionum, silent suspicions, IV. 41. 13
