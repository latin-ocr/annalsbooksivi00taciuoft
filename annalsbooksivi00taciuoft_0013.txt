TAcrrUS.

1. Very little is known of the life or personality of the
historian Tacitus. Even his name is matter of doubt. He is
commonly spoken of without praenomen, as Cornelius Taci-
tus. Sidonius Apollinaris, a Christian writer of the fifth cen-
tury, calls him Gaius, and the same name is given by some
manuscripts of inferior authority. The name Publius, however,
contained in the best manuscript of his writings, the so-called
F irst Medicean, is now generally accepted. As to his place
of birth, it has been guessed to be Interamna, because this was
the birthplace of the emperor Tacitus (A.D. 275—6), who
claimed relationship with him.l The slighting tone, however,
in which he mentions municipali adultero (IV. 3) and oppida·
num genus (VI. 15), would make it more probable that he
was a native of Rome. The date of his birth can be fixed
with only an approach to certainty. His intimate friend, the
younger Pliny, who was born A.D. 61 or 62, says (Epp. VII. 20)
that they were propemodum aequales ,· adding, adulescentulus,
cum iam tu fama gloriaque floreres, te sequi . . . concupiscebam.
He was thus enough older than Pliny to be a man of established
reputation when Pliny was a very young man, adulescentulus ,· a
difference of age which can hardly have been less than eight or
ten years. The year A.D. 54 is probably as late as we can place
his birth. This date is also supported by the facts of his official
career. He says of himself (ffi'st. Ι. 1) that his course of
