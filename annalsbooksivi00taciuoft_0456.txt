410 - TEXTUAL NOTES.

revived by Augustus, B.c. 1 1, its duties being meanwhile performed by the
pontiffs. It is possible that Tacitus carelessly eonfounded the death of
Cinna (B.C. 84) with his abdication (B.C. 87). At any rate the mistake is
as likely, as Pfitzner argues, to have been made by Tacitus himself as by
his transcribers.

62. 1. proximi hos Magnetes: the manuscript reading is proximo
magnetes.

68. 3. alia: most editors change to Atia, on the guess that the mother
of Silanus may have been of the same family as that of Augustus.

70. 4. egregium publice locum: this reading is suggested by Prof.
C. L. Smith (Harvard Studies, Vol. Ι. p. 107) for egregium publicum
of the manuscript. Professor Smith argues that bonas domi artes must
refer to private character, and the other phrase of course to professional
eminence; that egregium cannot be regarded as a substantive like bonum
in the phrase bonum publicum ,· nor, if it could be taken as a substantive,
could it be applied to Capito’s distinction as a jurist, but must signify
something belonging to the state (publicum). ΤΙιε word publice forms
a suitable antithesis to domi, and the reading publicum would be an easy
blunder of some copyist.

BOOK IV.

1. 2. ierit: the manuscript reading is perit. ⁷ ·

20. 6. proinde: most editions read perinde ,· but Nipperdey shows ‚ .
that there is ample authority for proinde with a comparative particle. ’
27. 2. calles evenerat: this is the manuscript reading, changed by
Lipsius to Cales, etc„ on the hypothesis that this ancient Campanian town ’
may have been the headquarters of one of the four quaestores classici in· ζ
stituted by Augustus, as Ostia certainly was one: but nothing is known of
any province os Cales, while it is a familiar fact that silvae callesque were the
provinces assigned by the senate to Caesar and his colleague (Suet. Iul. 19). ,ξ’
33. 4. Romanasne: in the manuscript the enelitic is ve, which cannot
properly stand in a double question. '
46. 1. incultu: this word is found in Sallust and Livy, but is changed ¹
by most editors to sine cultu, on account of the harshness of the expression.
50. 2. tantum his: the manuscript reading is quamvis. ,
69. 6. tegens: the manuscript reading is egens, which may be inter·
preted as helpless, distrustful. Other readings that have been proposed
are reticens, se tegens, et tegens. ⁷

BOOK V.

 

4. 2. domus Germanici exitium paenitentiae esse seni: the gg
manuscript reads germanicis titium paenitentiae senis. The correction to ’ᾗ

Germanici exitium is easy; it seems necessary to insert esse 3 for domus, ὲ
