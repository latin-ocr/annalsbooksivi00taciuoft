TACITUS.

quinquienS, praetoriarum cohortium militibus singula

Tum consultatum de honoribus3 ex quis maxime in-

(LVII.· 14) that the sum actually re-
ceived by each beneficiary was 260
sesterces -- 31 3.00 —too great a dis-
crepaney, even if we are to suppose
that Tiberius added something from
his own purse. We must assume,
therefore, with Marquardt (Ram.
Staatsverw. ΙΙ. 126) that the whole
amount was distributed viritim, and
find the distinction between populus
and plebs [tribubus] in the peculiar
organization of the tribes for ali·
mentary donations during the em-
pire. At this period, as Mommsen
says (Ram. Staatsv. ΙΙΙ. 1. 445),
“wherever the Tribes appear as
corporations, it is of this plebs sru-
mentarz'a,” consisting of a limited
number of persons, chiefly freed-
men, membership being a special
and personal privilege. The tribes,
as thus organized (not to be con-
founded with the voting tribes), con·
tinued in existence into the fourth
century. Note that, the number
of tribes being 35, the legacy of
3,500,ooo sesterces made 100,000
sesterces to each. The sesterce
(sestertius) was a coin, originally
of silver, but under the empir'e of
copper, of the value of a little
over four cents; the denarius was
four sesterces. The sestertium was
not a eoin, but a value of 1000
sesterces. In payment of large
sums gold was of course used (the
aureus was of the value of 100
sesterces); but, as the ratio of gold
to silver has since risen about one
third (from about 12: 1 to 16: 1),
it follows that the present value of
the sesterce in gold is over five
cents. As all these values are ap-
proximate, we will follow Momm-

sen's practice, and reckon the ses·

terce at five cents. When values · ’ 

are given with numeral adverbs‚ as
in this passage, we are to understand
centena milia sestertium.
praetoriarum cohortium, etc.:
the largess to the soldiers agrees
with the statements of Suetonius
and Dio Cassius (LVI. 32), exce t
that the text of Tacitus omits t e
five hundred sesterces apiece to the
soldiers of the city cohorts (urbanis
quingenos), and mentions the co-
horts of Roman citizens, omitted by
the other two. The present value
of these sums was about ,850 apiece

to the praetorians, 325 to the urbani, Δ ,ᾖ

and 815 to the members of the citi-
zen cohorts.

urbanis: the city cohorts were
three in number, one thousand
men in each. They belonged to
the guard of the capital, and were
numbered X., XL, and XIL, as if be-
longing with the praetorian cohorts;
they were, however, under the com-
mand, not of the praetorian praefect,
butof the praefectus urbi. SeeApp.1.

cohortibus civium Romano-

rum: these were cohorts of volun· . 1⁴

teers, 32 in number, raised in Italy,
while the legions were regularly
recruited in the provinces. They
ranked with the legionary cohorts‚
although not assigned to any legion,
and thus received the same don-a-
tion. For this reason, probably,
they are not mentioned by Sueto·

· nius and Dio.
