vi PREFACE.

notably, of Brambach. A full Index of Names and an Index
to the N otes will, it is hoped‚ add to the usefulness of the book.

As the commentary assumes that the reader is at a somewhat
advanced point in his Latin studies, little attention is paid to
the commonplaces of grammar 3 on the other hand, consider-
able prominence is given to the idiosyncracies of Tacitus'
Latinity, and to the changes which the language had under-
gone since the Ciceronian period. A leading aim in the com-
mentary is to present a connected view of the character and
reign of Tiberius, and to trace the constitutional and adminis-
trative changes which took place under that emperor. To
make the view more complete, the lost portions of the fifth
and sixth Books have been, in a measure, supplied by extracts .
from Dio CassiuS, Suetonius, and Juvenal.

The long and concentrated study of Tacitus has accumulated
a rich store of illustrative material that is now the common
property of scholarship. This material has been freely used for
the present edition 3 but special acknowledgment is due for aid
derived from the editions of Furneaux (Clarendon PreSS‚ Oxford‚
1884), Nipperdey (8th edition, by Andresen, Berlin, 1884),
Drager (4th edition, Leipsic‚ 1882), and Pfitzner (Gotha, 1884),
and also from Drager's Syntax und Stil des Tacitus (3'd ed„
LeipsiC‚ 1882), and Gerber and Greef's Lexicon Taciteum
(A-M., Leipsic‚ 1877—88). In the discussion of constitu-
tional and antiquarian questions Mommsen's labors have been
of great service3 Marquardt and Madvig have also been fre-
quently consulted. Indebtedness to other recent works and

monographs is acknowledged at the pertinent points in the
Introduction and the notes.
