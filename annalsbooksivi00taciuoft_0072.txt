admits to have been due to the
enmity of Macro, and perhaps not
even known to the emperor (VI.
47). The death of Piso was the re-
sult of an open criminal prosecution;
the charge of Tacitus is, therefore,
without foundation, unless, perhaps,
in relation to Gallus.

orator (IV. 61), but of a mea'n

7. Palatium: originally identi-

the hill. Augustus built a splendid
house here, and the name of the
hill became especially associated
with the imperial residence, which
hence became known as palatium.

From this the word ‘palace' has -’
