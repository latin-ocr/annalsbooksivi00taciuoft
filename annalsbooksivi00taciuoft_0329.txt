’“ 3. eius rei: i.e. the omission of etc. A still more influential cause

confarreatio.

penes: used with things only
here, Hist. Ι. 57, and Hor. A. P.
71; Intr. 35 i.

diffic'ultates: not only in the
cumbersome ceremonial, but in the
process of divorce (diffareatio),
equally cumbersome and difficult3

’ and the Romans of this age did not

fancy having any obstacles in the
way of divorce.

e iure patrio: every paterfami-
lias had through life his sons and
unmarried daughters under his ab·
solute authority (patria potestas),
which included the power of life
and death (ius vitae necisque).

ἒ sse son might be freed from this

‘authority by being emancipated, or
by being adopted into another
family ; also the flamen dialis and
the vestal virgins were sui iuris.
Τὴε authority of the paterfamilias
extended also to his wife, who was
in loco filiae, but in her case it was
called manus instead of poteslas,-
therefore quae in manum flami-
nis conveniret was his wife, the
flaminica. The disqualifications at·
tending the office would be a second
reason (besides the disuse of con-
farreatio) for the want of candi-
dates for the office3 on this view
et connects this clause with the
causal ablative absolute omissa,

must have been the numerous and
vexatious petty requirements which
attended the office (ΙΙΙ. 58. 1 n.);
and Nipperdey thinks that some
words describing these must have
dropped out (Gell. X. 15).

flamonium: this is attested by
inscriptions to be the correct form,
instead of flaminium.

4. lege: leges, passed by the peo-
ple in comitia, were still adopted,
although this form of legislation was
being rapidly superseded by senatus
consulta and edicts of the emperor.

Augustus: eg. with regard to
absence from the city (III. 71. 3).

5. tractatis religionibus, after
taking into consideration all relig·-
ious aspects.

flaminica Dialis, etc.: a woman
married by confarreatio or coemptio
came as a matter of course into the
manus of her husband3 but by the
third form of marriage (usus) it was
possible to avoid this, and the mar-
riage without manus had now be-
come the usual form. At the same
time, while the woman escaped the
manus of her husband, the potestas
of her father was so far relaxed that
she was practically her own mistress.
Maine describes the relation at this
period ‘⁴ as amounting in law to lit-
tle more than a temporary deposit
of the woman by her family ’⁹ (Anc.
