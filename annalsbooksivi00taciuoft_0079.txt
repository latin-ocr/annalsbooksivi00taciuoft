legioni eum honorem quaerebant, alio vertunt atque una
tres aquilas et signa cohortium locant ; simul congerunt 4
caespites, exstruunt tribunal quo magis conspicua sedes

foret.

Properantibus Blaesus advenit, increpabatque ac re— 5
tinebat singUIOS, clamitans: ‘ Mea potius caede imbuite
manus 3 leviore flagitio legatum interficietis'quam ab irn-
peratore desciscitis, Aut incolumis fidem legionum reti- 6

neb0, aut iugulatus paenitentiam. accelerab0.’ Aggeraba- 19

tur nihilo minus caespes, iamque pectori usque accreverat,

cum tandem pervicacia victi inceptum omisere.

Blae- 2

sus multa dicendi arte non per seditionem et turbas
desideria -militum ad Caesarem ferenda ait, neque veteres

3. eum honorem: i.e. of being
the one—retaining its individual
organization, absorbing the other

' legions into itself‚ and giving its

name to the united body.

alio: i.e. have recourse to an·
other plan.

tres aquilas, etc. ε the silver eagle
was made by Marius the ,standard
of each legion. Besides this each
maniple had a signum. It has been
questioned whether a cohort had a
separate standard, and the present
passage has been explained as mean-
ing the three manipular standards
of the several cohorts. Caesar, how-
ever (B. G. II. 25), says: quartae
cohortis . . . szgnisero interficto,
szgrno amisso, which seems to prove
that the eohort had a standard and
standard-bearet of its own.

4. tribunal: this was a raised
platform used in Rome by the prae-
tors and other magistrates for the
administration of justice. As the
consul and military tribunes exer-
cised judicial power, there was a
tribunal in every camp made of turs,
which was used also for the purpose
of addressing the soldiers; this was

in the middle of the camp, at the
left of the general's tent, praeto·
rium. On this occasion the soldiers
seem to have erected a new tribunal,
probably in the middle of their own
quarters.

sedes: the place where they col-
lected their standards.

5. properantibus: best taken as
dative.

leviore flagitio, etc. : a very con-
densed expression‚—It will be a
lzgrlzter fault for you to, etc.

legatum, commander: i.e. Blae-
sus. As governor of the prov·
ince, and commander of its forces,
his full title was legatus Augusti
pro praetore, ‘ deputy of the em-
peror with praetorian powers ' (Intr.
1 ).

719. aggerabatur ε the manu·
script reads aggerebatur, a much

weaker expression: moreover, the
eompound, according to the usual

orthography of the manuscript,
should be adgerebatur.

2. multa . . . arte: ablative of
quality.

veteres: i.e. in the time of the
Republic. ”
