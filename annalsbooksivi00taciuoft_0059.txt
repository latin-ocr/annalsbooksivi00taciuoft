and that was, under the empire,
solely the emperor. It was there-
fore equivalent to an oath of alle-
giance to him as supreme ruler. It
was now exacted once a year, and was
moreover extended to all classes—-
senatus milesque et populus.
See chap. 343 also Momm. Ram.
St. ΙΙ. 749.

Seius Strabo: the father of Seja-
nus, who was afterwards associated
with him in this office.

The praetorian praefect, praefec-
tus praetorio, at first merely com·
mander of the emperor’s body-guard,
was afterwards the most powerful

’ officer in the state. The praetorian

cohorts were nine in number, each
of a thousand men commanded by
a tribune, the whole body being
regularly commanded by two prae-
fects (at this time only one). Three
of these cohorts were stationed in
the city, the rest in other parts of
Italy ; but Sejanus concentrated the
whole body in a fortified camp just
outside the city walls. This prae-
torian camp served as a fortress to
keep the city in subjection.

> annonae: the office of praefectus
annonae was established in the last
partos the reign of Augustus; the
date is not certainly known. The
first incumbent was Gaius Turranius,
who was still holding the office, A.D.
48 (XI. 31). As the title proefect

sentative of the emperor, who in
person had the cura annonae, as
well as the imperium over the whole
empire (Momm. Ram. St. II. 966).
The praefectus annonae was taken

from the equestrian order, and ap-
pointed for an indefinite ‘term3 at
this time his office ranked as the
first of the equestrian dignities, but
it afterwards stood third in rank
among these (Hirschfeld, Unter·
suchungen, p. 135). His duties
were to provide the markets of the
capital with grain and other neces·
saries, and to oversee the sailors,
bakers, etc., who performed the la· ,
bor' m detail.

The praefectus praetorio and
praejectus annonae were, in the
early empire, the highest regular
offices under the emperor; that of
praefectus urbi being at this time
only occasiona13 see VI. 11.

4. incipiebat. the use of the’ im-
perfect here 1s not to denote custo-
mary action (was in the habit os
begznning), but to describe his pol-
icy at this time, when he had not
yet in strictness of speech begun to
reign, following the Latin usage
of expressing by a verb what the
English expresses by an abstract
noun (Intr. 35 a),—at this time
he did all these things through the
consuls, the regular constitutional
channels. Whatever he did him-
self he did by virtue of the tribuni-
cian and proconsular powers, which
he already possessed.

vetere re publica. not ablative
absolute, but of circumstance, —as
if the republic were still· in existence.

ambiguus imperandi, as if he
had not yet made up his mind to
accept the imperium.

5. edictum: every magistrate
had the right of issuing edicta or
proclamations, and the tribunes had
