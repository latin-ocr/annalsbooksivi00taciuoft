408 TEXTUAL NOTES.

81. 1. tractui-is: the manuscript reading is tracturus ,· but if this
were retained, as it must agree with Germanicus, vi sua would be inap-
propriate, as it would be by the force of the legions, not his own, that he
would act.

34. 1. seque et proximos: the manuscript reading is seque proxi·
mos, for which this is the simplest emendation. Some editions read

- Sequanos ‚· but the Sequani belonged to Belgica, and it is not likely that

one Belgian state would have been specified without some special reason.

35. 3. promptos: the manuscript reads promptas, and some editions
insert res ,· the emendation here given is simplet and more probable. Cf.
IV. 59. 5 n.

36. 3. concedentur: many editors change to concederentur, under-
standing erat with in ancipiti. But although the indirect form is dropped
with suscipi, the thought in periculosa . . . res publica is still that of
Germanicus and his friends; from their point of view concedentur is cor-
rect, and the verb to be supplied with the three subjects 1s est.

59. 6. sacerdotium hominum. some editors, following F. A. Wolf,
correct hominum to Romanum.

70. 7. Visurgin: this, the manuscript reading, is impossible, and
some editors have made up the word Unsingin, as a probable Latin form

for Hunse, a river> in Groningen. Very likely Tacitus did not give the ”,

name of the river at all.

77. 5. spectarentur: Halm, after Wo'lfflin, reads sectarentur, which
reading has the advantage of not requiring a change of subject ; the pro-
hibition of private performances is a very probable oue.

BOOK II.

8. 2. subvexit aut transposuit: the manuscript reading is defective,
and various emendations have been proposed. Of these the insertion of
aut appears the least violent ; ‚but it is not improbable that subvexit
is a gloss.

4. Angrivariorum: many editions change to Ampsivariorum (a na-
tion upon the Ems, —the Ems-sarers), and make the same change in
22. 3 and 24. 5, on the assumption that the camp mentioned was the first
after crossing that river. The interpretation here given (that of Knoke),
that the camp is upon the Weser, makes a change of the text unnecessary.
Knoke, however, asin many other instances, undertakes to describe the line
of march with more particularity of detail than our information warrants.

9. 3. permissum: the manuscript reading is permissu, and Nip-
perdey supplies the words imperatoris deducitur a Stertinio. But it 'is
easier to suppose the dropping out of a single letter m; moreover, the
reading here given appears more in keeping with the style of Tacitus than

the other.
