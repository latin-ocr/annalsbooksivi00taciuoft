xii INTRODUCI'ION.

century transcriptS. The extant portions of the larger works
are contained in two manuscripts of the ninth, tenth, or eleventh
century ; one (the First Medicean) containing the four first
books of the Annals with what remains of the fifth and sixth,
the other (the Second Medicean) the remaining portion of the
Annals (Books XI. to XVI.) with the Ilzktories. These manu-
scripts were brought from Germany to Italy, and are now in the
Medicean Library of F lorence. The latter portion was printed
in 1470 ; the earlier portion, that contained in the present
edition, was brought to Rome in 1508, and printed by order of

Pope Leo X. in 1515.
THE ANNArs.

5. The form of the Annah is, as the name indicates, strictly
chronological. The events of each year are told by themselves,
so that any independent series of events can be read in connec-
tion only by taking in succession several detached passages ς to
this rule there are but one or two exceptions (ag. VI. 31-3 7).
As has been already said, the extant portions of the work con-
sist of two distinct parts, separated by a gap of four books.
This gap covers the reign of Caligula and most of that of
Claudius (A.D. 37 to 54), while the two extant portions com-
prise the reigns of Tiberius and Nero respectively. The
accounts of these two reigns are preserved nearly complete.
The present edition contains the first part, the reign of Tibe-
rius, comprising the first six books, of which, however, nearly
the whole of the fifth book and perhaps a quarter of the sixth
are missing. The missing portions contained the year 30 with
the greater part of 29 and 31, the reign of Tiberius extending
from A.D. 14 to 37. In biographical importance, for estimating
the character of Tiberius, and understanding the puzzling events
of the closing years of his reign, these lost parts of the work
must have ranked among the very highest, for they contained
an account of the destruction of the family of Germanicus and

the downfall of Sejanus,
