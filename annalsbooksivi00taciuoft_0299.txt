Dianae Leucophrynae : the
temple of this goddess at Magnesia
ranked in splendor and beauty next
to those of Artemis at Ephesus and
the Didymaean Apollo at Miletus,
among the temples of Asia Minor ;
her cult was similar to that of ⁶ Diana
of the Ephesiansss

2. Aphrodisienses, etc.: Aph-
rodisias and Stratonicea, as well as
Magnesia, were in Caria.

in partis: zze. in the civil war.
This proclamation of Caesar, which
is recorded in an extant inscription,
has reference to Aphrodisias alone;
that of Augustus to Stratonicea
alone, which by itself resisted the
invasion of the Parthians under La-
bienus, B.C. 40. laudati, therefore,
belongs only to Stratonicenses.

3. Veneris: i.e. Aphrodite, from
whose name that of the city was
derived.

Iovis: the temple of Zeus Chry-
saoreos at Stratonicea was the com-
mon place of assemblage for the
cities of Caria (Strab. XIV. p. 660).

Triviae: Hecate, the goddess of
occult mysteries—worshipped where
three ways met.

4. Dianam: this Diana appears
to have been identical with the
Ephesian Artemis. A Persian cult
is described by Pausanias (V. 27. 3)
at Hierocaesarea as a kind of fire
worship, conducted by a magian

Hierocaesarea was in Lydia.

Perpennae, Isaurici: limiting
nomina. Perpenna (usually spelt
Perperna) commanded in Asia, B.C.
129; P. Servilius Isauricus (son of
the eminent Isauricus), 13.C. 46.

duobus milibus passuum: i.e.
in every direction from the temple.
This is illustrated by an inscription
found at Oropus, in which it is
stated that the temple of Amphia-
raus at that place received from
Sulla a grant of immunity from pub·
lic burdens, to which was added:
voti reddendi causa aedi Amphiarai
agrum tribuo undequaque pedum
M. ut lzz'c quoque ager sacer sit.
Mommsen in Hermes, XX. p. 268.

5. Veneri: the island of Cyprus
was believed to have been the birth·
place of Aphrodite, and the cities of
Paphos and Salamis were the prin-
