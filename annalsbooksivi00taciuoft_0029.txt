GOVERNMENT OF THE EMPIRE. XXV

22. Besides the emperor, there was no real possessor of
power except the senate. The people‚ the ultimate source of
authority in the RepubliC, were stripped of all effective share in
the government ς the emperor, by virtue of his tribunician
power, may be regarded as embodying in himself the popular
element of the constitution. The elections of magistrates were
now mostly transferred to the senate (I. 15), while the edicts
of the princeps and, by degrees, the ordinances of the senate
acquioed the force of law. The constitution of the empire is
described by Mommsen as a Dyarclzy, in which the powers of
government were shared between the senate and the emperor.
But in a partnership like this, in which the exclusive military
power and supreme administrative authority were vested in
one of the two partners, nothing could prevent absolute power
from eventually centring in his hands—a result which was
hastened by the servility and obsequiousness of the senate. It
was a real monarchy, although obscured under the forms of a
republic.

23. As in the RepubliC, the magistrates were the organs of
the senate, being now in a considerable part appointed by that
body. The administrative authority of the emperor within the
city was exercised through a body of officers, praefecti and
curatores, appointed by him and responsible solely to him 3
and it followed as a matter of course that these officers soon
crowded the regular magistrates out of the chief part of their
functions. Two of these praefects by the nature of their duties
became the leading officers in the state3 the praefectus prae-
torio, who, as commander of the body-guard, exercised chief
military authority in Italy 3 and the praejectus urbi, who, in the
reign of Tiberius, was the chief municipal officer. The prae-
fect of the city exercised criminal justice in the name of the
emperor, concurrently with the quaestiones perpetuae, presided
over by the praetors; but his authority was not long in super-
seding the quaestiones, which before the end of the second
century had disappeared entirely. The praetors who exercised
