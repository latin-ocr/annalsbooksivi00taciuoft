TACITUS. [Boox IV.

accusante provincia causam dixerit, magna curn as-
severatione principis, non' se ius nisi in servitia et
pecunias familiares dedisse ; quod si vim praetoris
usurpasset manibusque militum usus foret, spreta in eo
mandata sua: audirent socios, Ita reus cognito negotio
damnatur. Ob quam ultionem, et quia priore anno in
C. Silanum vindicatum erat, decrevere Asiae urbes
templum Tiberio matrique eius ac senatui. Et per-
missum statuere; egitque Nero grates ea causa patri-
bus atque aVO, laetas inter audientium adfectioneS, qui
recenti memoria Germanici illurn aspici, illum audiri
rebantur. Aderantque iuveni modestia ac forma prin-
cipe viro digna, notis in eum Seiani odiis ob periculum
gratiora.

Sub idem tempus de flamine Diali in locum Servi

Maluginensis defuncti legend0, simul roganda nova lege .

disseruit Caesar: nam patricios confarreatis parentibus
genitos tres simul nominari, ex quis unus legeretur,
vetusto more; neque adesse, ut olim, eam copiam, .
omissa confarreandi assuetudine aut inter paucos re·

causam dixerit: i.e. before the
senate.

dedisse: sc. ei.

vim praetoris: ΞΛ. of the provin-
cial governor (Ι. 74. 1 n); if the pro-
curator had usurped the functions
of governor, it was by no authority;
for his powers extended only to mat-
ters touching the emperor’s private
property (pecunias familiares).

socios: see ΙΙΙ. 55. 3 n.-

4. C. Silanum: see III. 66-69.

ternplum: see 55 and 56.

5. Nero: the cities of Asia were
his clients, as those of Sicily were
the clients of Cicero in the action
against Verres.

16. Maluginensis: see ῙΙῙ. 58.
1 and 71. 3.

nova lege: zze. in regard to fill-
ing this priesthood. The flamen
dialis must be a patrician whose
parents had been married by the
peeuliarly patrician rite of consar-
reati0,· he must himself have been
married by the same rite to a woman
of the same qualifications, and his
wife, the flaminica, had also certain
official duties. As the patrician
body had now become much re·
duced in numbers, and the antique
eeremony of confarreatio had al-
most gone out of use, it was very
difficult to find qualifie'd candidates.
The selection was made by the pon-
tifex maximus, who had authority
to take (capere) a qualified person
even against his will.
