moral practices. The Jews also were
numerous and influential at Rome.
The scandalous incidents which led
to the demolition of the temples of
Isis, and to the banishment of the
Jews, are related by Josephus (Ant.
Iud. XVIII. 3, 4 and 5).

libertini generis: they had been
brought to Rome as slaves.

ea superstitione : apparently the
Jewish, for Suetonius says (Tib.
36), Iudaeorum iuventutem per
speciem sacramenti in provincias
gravioris caeli distribuit.

quis: dative of possession.

latrociniis: Intr. 35 fl Sardinia
was then, as in modern times, in-
fested with banditti, whom they were
to suppress. Its climate still con-
tinues unhealthy.

86. rettulit: brought the busi-
ness before the senate.

virginem: sc. Vestalem. The

word capere is used technieally for
the selection of a vestal. (Aul.
Gell. Ι. 12. 13).

Vestalibus sacris praesederat:
this does not mean as head or eldest
of the collegium, maxima virgv,· it
is the technical expression for having
charge of the sacred rites, and is
thus applicable to all the vestals.

2. discidio, divorce.

domum: i.e. dignitatem domus.
This was not an absolute bar, for the
law only required that both parents
should be living.

imminuerat: cf. auctus, 84. 3.

deciens sestertii: this appears
to have been the usual dowry for a
noble lady.

87. binos nummos: two ses-
terces = ten cents. This was the
difference between the legal price
and the market value at the time.
The modius was about a peck.
