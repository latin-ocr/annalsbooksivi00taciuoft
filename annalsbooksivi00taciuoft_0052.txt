Neronem et Claudium Drusum privignos imperatoriis
2 nominibus auxit, integra etiam tum domo sua. Nam
genitos Agrippa Gaium ac Lucium 111 familiam Caesarum
induxerat, necdum posita puerili praetexta principes iu-

ventutis appellari, destinari consules specie recusantls
flagrantissime cupiverat. Ut Agrippa vita concessu,

privignos: they were sons of his
wife Livia, by her former husband.
For all these relationships‚ see Table,
Intr. 26.

imperatoriis nominibus: the
emperors assumed the title Impe-
rator as a praenomen; the use here
indicated, however, is that of the
republic, as an appellation bestowed
after victory. Both Tiberius and
Drusus carried on successful⁴ cam·
paigns in Germany‚ and the use of
this title by them is attested by
inscriptions. >

own house consisted of his grand-
children, Gaius and Lucius; but
even during their lifetime' he heaped
these honors upon his stepso'ns.

in familiam induxerat: by the
regular form of adoption3 per as·
sem et libram emptos a patre Agrippa,
Suet. Oct. 64‚——a remarkable illus·
tration of the survival of primitive
forms.

praetexta: the toga praetexta,
with a purple stripe about its bor·
der, was worn by curule magis-
trates, and also by boys until they
assumed the toga virilis at about
the age of sixteen.
