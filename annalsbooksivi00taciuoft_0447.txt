hereditary character.

38. 1, meminisse posteros volo, etc.

similar remark is attributed by Plu-
tarch to Pompey (Pomp. 14) com-
paring himself to Sulla.

was cruel and vindictive, but loyal

genius as a statesman.

Caligula did in fact put Tiberius
Gemellus to death this very year,
and was himself murdered four
years later. Josephus (Ant. Iud.

“ . num ad internoscenda corpori suo utilia vel noxia alieni

XVIII. 6, 9) tells a story how Ti-
berius undertook to foretell which
of the two boys should be his suc-
cessor, by noting which of them
should attend upon him first on a
certain morning, and how his at-
tempt to trick the fates, by contriv-
ing that it should be his favorite
Tiberius, failed. He then puts in
the mouth of the old man an earnest
and pathetic appeal to Caligula to
treat his cousin with kindness; for
he would be a support to his house
and authority, rather than a rival.

his alleged debauchery.
