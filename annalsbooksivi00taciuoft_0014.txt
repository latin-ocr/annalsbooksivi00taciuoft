x INTRODUcrloN.

honors was under the three emperors Vespasian‚ Titus, and
Domitian 3 it is known that he held the praetorship A.D. 88.
As Vespasian died A.D. 79, it is not likely that he was less than
twenty—five at this date, this being the earliest age at which the
quaestorship, the first of the honores, could be held.

2. In the year 78 Tacitus married the daughter of the eminent
soldier Agricola, whose life he afterwards wrote. After his
praetorship in the year 88, he was absent from Rome for several
years 3 it is conjectured that he held some governmental office
during this · interval, perhaps in Germany, where he may have
gathered the materials for his work descriptive of that country.
During his absence his father-in-law Agricola died. His own

death was probably A.D. 116 ; as the description of the empire .

given in the Annals (nunc rubrum ad mare patescit, II. 61)
corresponds to the condition of things in the last year of
Trajan, who died in 1 17. This includes territories which were
annexed to the empire by Trajan, A.D. 115, but immediately
surrendered by his successor Hadrian.

3. The works of Tacitus are :--

(1) Dialogus de OratoribuS, a short treatise, in a studied
Ciceronian style, so different from that of his later works that
its authenticity has been a subject of doubt and controversy.

(2) De vita Iulii Agricolae, written A.D. 97 or 98 : a master-
piece of biographical composition.

(3) Germania, or De origine, situ, moribus ac populis
Germanorum, written in the year 98 ; our best source of infor-
mation with regard to the ancient Germans.

(4) Historiae, a history of his own times, from the accession
of Galba (69) to the death of Domitian (96). Of the fourteen
books of this work there are extant the four first books and part
of the fifth, embracing in part the events of the years 69 and 70.

(5) Annales,¹ entitled in the manuscript Ab excessu divi
