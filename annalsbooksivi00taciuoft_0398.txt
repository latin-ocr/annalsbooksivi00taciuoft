acquittal had been for his sake. Thus, if there was no other charge
against a man, this was enough for his punishment, that he had been a

friend of Sejanus, just as if it had not been on account of the friendship   ’

of Tiberius that others had paid court to him. Such accusations were
brought especially by those who had been most devoted to Sejanus; for
since they knew accurately who were like-minded with themselves, they
had no trouble in bringing accusations and proofs. . . .

15. Of those who were accused, many appeared in person and spoke
in their own defence with great freedom of spirit 3 but most took their
own lives before being condemned. They did this especially in order to
escape the disgrace and outrage (for all who were arrested on any such

charge, not only knights but also senators, not only men but also women, ¹

were crowded into the prison, and after being condemned some were put
to death there, and others were hurled from the Tarpeian Rock by the
tribunes or consuls, and their bodies tossed into the Forum, and after this
thrown into the river), and also in order that their children might inherit
their property. For they confiscated only a very small proportion of the
property of those who committed suicide before judgment, it being the

policy of Tiberius to lead them to self-destruction by this inducement, so , ¹
that it might not appear that it was he who worked their destruction—as - ” .·
if it were not a much more terrible thing to compel a man to slay himself , '1

than to give him over directly to the executioner.

The condemnation of Sejanus is thus described by Juvenal, 1‘0. 56-77 :—

Quosdam praecipitat subiecta potentia magnae
Invidiae: mergit longa atque insignis honorum
Pagina. Descendunt statuae restemque sequuntur,
Ipsas deinde rotas bigarum impacta securis

Caedit et immeritis franguntur crura caballis:

Iam strident ignes, iam follibus atque caminis

Ardet adoratum populo caput et erepat ingens
Seianus; deinde ex facie toto orbe secunda

Fiunt urceoli pelves sartago matellae.

Pone domi laurus, duc in Capitolia magnum
Cretatumque bovem: Seianus ducitur unco
Spectandus: gaudent omnes. ‘ Quae labra, quis illi
Vultus erat! numquam, si quid mihi credis, amavi
Hunc hominem! sed quo cecidit sub crimine? quisnam
Delator? quibus indiciis, quo teste probavit? ’

Nil horum: verbosa et grandis epistula venit

A Capreis. —‘ Bene habet: nil plus interrogo. — Sed quid
Turba Remi? ’ Sequitur fortunam ut semper et odit
Damnatos: idem populus, si Nortia Tusco

Favisset, si oppressa foret secura senectus

Principis, hae ipsa Seianum diceret hora

Augustum.
