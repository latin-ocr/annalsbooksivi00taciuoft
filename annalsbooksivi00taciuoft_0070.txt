Inter quae senatu ad infimas obtestationes procum-
bente, dixit forte Tiberius se, ut non toti rei publicae
parem, ita quaecumque pars sibi mandaretur, eius tute-

lam suscepturum.

Tum Asinius Gallus: ‘Interrogo'

Rursum Gallus (etenim vultu

Dio Cassius (LVII. 2), he suggested
a division into three parts— Rome
and Italy, the armies, and the sub-

Italy, stood to the provinces in the
time of the republic, as governor
to governed, while the provinces
themselves were divided by Augus-
tus into the two classes here de-
scribed—those which required a
military force (the imperial prov-
inces), and those which did not (the
senatorial).

5. in toga: contrasted with vic-

the distinctive Roman garment (gens

in their civil capacity, and is, there-

peaceful with warlike relations.
