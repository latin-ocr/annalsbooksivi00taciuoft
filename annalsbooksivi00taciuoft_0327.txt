ANNALS.

A.D. 23.] 281

postremo Caesar de immodestia histrionum rettulit:
multa ab iis in publicum seditiose, foeda per domos
temptari; Oscum quondam ludicrum, levissimae apud
vulgum oblectationiS, eo flagitiorum et virium venisse
ut auctoritate patrum coercendum sit. Pulsi tum his-
triones Italia.

Idem annus alio quoque luctu Caesarem adficit, alte· 15
rum ex geminis Drusi liberis exstinguendO, neque

per domos, in private homes.

Oscum ludicrum: a kind of
low farce, in the Oscan dialect, the
speech of Campania and central

under the direction of the censors,
—the magistrates who had the
charge of public contracts. The
first explanation seems the most
reasonable.

 

Italy, sufficiently like the Latin to
be understood by the Romans,—
just as the Scotch dialect is under·
stood upon our stage. By levissi-
mae oblectationis is meant the
frivolous amusement of the popu-
lace; once (quondam) this was the
worst that could be said of it.
pulsi, etc.: they were allowed to

⁷ return by Caligula (Dio, LIX. 2).

15⁴. alterum: his name was
Germanicus, and his age four.

2. Rhodii secessus: see I. 4.
413. novo homini: i.e. none of
{ilis ancestors had held curule of-
egensorium funus: a magnificent
public funeral. The term is ex-
plained by some as being such a

, funeral as was given to censors,

whose office was the first in dignity
and bonon by others, as being

forum Augusti: a public square
opened by Augustus to the north-
east of the Forum Romanum, and
adorned with the statues of distin-
guished generals3 portions of its
heavy walls, and the portico of the
Temple of Mars Ultor, situated in
it, are still to be seen ; other fora
were made by other emperors to
the north and south of it.

procurator: the procurator was
the special agent of the emperor,
especially in matters which related
to the fiscus, or privy purse (I. 80.
2). There was one in every prov·
ince; and in the smallest provinces,
like Judaea and Alpes Maritimae, he
was the sole governor. Standing in
a specially close relation to the em-
peror, it might have been expected
that he would be, like the slaves of
the emperor, subject to his private
jurisdiction.
