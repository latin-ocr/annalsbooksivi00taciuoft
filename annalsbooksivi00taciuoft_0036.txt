xxxii INTRODUCFION.

——as there was no substance of political discussion—necessa-
rily took shape in florid verbiage.

30. As to syntactical changes, it is enough to quote Drager’s
remark in relation to the history of the Latin language, that
“in the course of nearly eight hundred years it experienced
relatively slight changes in its grammatical construction.” A
few such changes will be pointed out in the notes.

31. The larger part of the peculiarities of Tacitus are his
own, not those of his age. He has the characteristics of his
age, but they are so inconspicuous in comparison with his indi-
vidual characteristics as to be almost obscured3 he is hardly
less strongly contrasted with Pliny and Quintilian than with

32. This suggestion doesnot confine itself to his literary
style alone, but to his style of thought and manner of present-

ent day. He did not consider it his duty in controverted
points to present both sides impartially, but to present his own
side 3 and when his own mind was made up, he could not see
