multitud0, nuper acto in urbe dilectu, lasciviae sueta,
laborum intoleranS, implere ceterorum rudes animos:
venisse tempus quo veterani maturam missionem, iuvenes
largiora stipendia, cuncti modum miseriarum exposcerent
saevitiamque centurionum ulciscerentur.

Non unus haec, ut Pannonicas inter legiones Percen-
niUS, nec apud trepidas militum aures alios validiores
exercitus respicientium, sed multa seditionis ora voces-
que: sua in manu sitam rem Romanam, suis victoriis
augeri rem publicam, in suum cognomentum adscisci

Nec legatus obviam ibat: quippe plurium

Repente lymphati de-

strictis gladiis in centuriones invadunt: ea vetustis-

Mommsen, these troops, hastily
levied after the disaster of Varus,
were taken from those members of
the city populace who did not pos-
sess citizenship. Suetonius says of
Augustus (Oct. 2 5) ε libertino milite,
praeterquam Romae incendiorum
causa et si tumultus in graviore
annona metueretur, bis usus est,-
semel ad praesidium coloniarum
Illyricum contingentium ,· iterum
ad tutelam ripae Rheni fluminis,
the latter being the ease in question.
implere: i.e. with the notions
expressed by venisse, etc.
maturam missionem, etc.: the
same demands as those of the Pan·
nonian soldiers. Cf. 17. 8.
iuvenes : those in active service.
5. respicientium: the Panno-
nian legions were so near Italy, that
they might expect to be promptly
crushed by new forces brought
against them.
imperatores: not emperors, but
commanders: referring to Drusus
and his son, their present com-

mandet, both of whom bore the
name Germanicus. The name, de-
rived from that of the province, was
also borne by the brother of Ger·

manicus, the emperor Claudius: ,

senatus . . . decrevit' Germanici
cognomen ipsi [Drusus] posterisque
eius (Suet. Claud. 1); sometimes
also by Tiberius.

32. obviam ibat: zze. the erner-¹
gency.

vecordia: the prefix ve expresses
negative, and often positive evil, as
in Vediovis, tlte evil Jupiter ,· ve-
cors, with mind led astray. Cf.
Aulus Gellius, V. 12.

constantiam, presence of mind.

2. ea, these, referring to the centu-
rions, but attracted to agree with
materies. The centurions, whose
badge was a vine-stick, were chiefly
remembered by the men as using
this in flogging them.

numerum: there being sixty
centurions to a legion3 ‘the men
wanted to show them what it was
to have sixty floggers.' Holbrooke.
