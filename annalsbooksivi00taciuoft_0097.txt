¹⁴ · tain that there was an element of

weakness and ostentation in his
character, but there is no reason for
questioning his sincerity here, and
the action was consistent with his
whole career. When we consider
how many emperors were afterwards
made by just such circumstances as
these‚—and some of them on this

’ - very spot, — we see that Germanicus

resisted a real temptation, and did
a real service to the state. His
personal popularity would have
made him, at the head of eight
legions, a formidable rival to his
ungppglsszelrlrrllgl’e-etc.: the soldiers
were irregularly grouped by cohorts
(34. 4), and the crowded mass
further off is contrasted with the
few bold mutineers who left the
main body, and pressed up close to
where Germanicus stood.

acutiorem: i.e. than his own.

omitteretur, should be lest un-
guarded, by the departure of the
mutineers to plunder Gaul. The
subjunctive of protasis depending
on a future participle is found in
Livy and later writers. .

auxilia: the auxiliaries now in
the army; socii: the forces which
might be raised among the allied
states of Gaul, such as the AEdui,
Remi, and Lingones, who were
within the territorial limits of the
province, but nominally indepen-
dent and not in strict law subject
to Rome. The inhabitants of the
provinces seem to have been better
disposed than the Roman legiona-
ries; cf. 39. 8. .

suscipi: the present tense im-
plies that calling out this levy, etc.‚
would be in itself an act of civil war.
