that the facts, as he gave them himself, did not, as we can see
now, always prove his point. In this, as we have said, there
appears no trace of insineerity, no attempt to conceal or distort
the facts. But his conception of the duties of an historian
was that of his own age, different from ours. I cannot agree
with the special defenders of Tiberius, who act as if the only
way to vindicate their hero was to impugn the motives of his
