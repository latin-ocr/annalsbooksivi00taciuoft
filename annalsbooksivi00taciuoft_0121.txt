Chattos, sed exterruit Caecina huc illuc ferens arma; et
Marsos congredi ausos prospero proelio cohibuit.

Neque multo post legati a Segeste venerunt auxilium 57
orantes adversus vim popularium, a quis circumsedeba-
tur, validiore apud eos Arminio, quoniam bellum suade-

bat; nam barbariS, quanto quis audacia promptus, tanto

magis fidus rebusque commotis potior habetur. Addi- 2

derat Segestes legatis filium, nomine Segimundum ; sed

iuvenis conscientia cunctabatur. Quippe anno quo Ger-
maniae descivere sacerdos apud aram Ubiorum creatus
ruperat vittaS, profugus ad rebelles. Adductus tamen 3
in spem clementiae Romanae pertulit patris mandata
benigneque exceptus cum praesidio Gallicam in ripam
missus est.

 

7. Cheruscis: they lived to the

, northeast of the Chatti, in the

modern Hanover. Under the lead-
ership of Arminius, they were the

, ’ foremost people of Germany; when

Tacitus wrote they had fallen into a
secondary rank (Germ. 36).

exterruit Caecina: by advanc·
ing in an easterly direction from
Vetera (ξ 1), he made a diversion
in favor of Germanicus, defeating
the Marsi and preventing the
Cherusci from assembling.

huc illuc: in the Agricola (10)
Tacitus still used the more common
classical form, huc atque illuc.

57. validiore, more influential.

promptus . . . magis fidus:
Intr. 35 m.

2. conscientia: i.e. of his pre-
vious want of fidelity. The omis·
sion of the genitive marks an ap-
proach to the modern meaning,
conscience.

quippe: an asseverative parti·
cle, in truth. Its frequent use in
classica] Latin to emphasize a causal
relation, gave the word by degrees
a causal meaning, so that it is used

by the later writers as nearly equiva-
lent to quoniam or etenim.

Germaniae: i.e. the nations of
Germany.

apud aram Ubiorum: within
the Roman lines. The cult was
probably that of Augustus and
Rome, to take part in which was a
recognition ofv the Roman sover-
eignty. According to Guiraud (Les
assemblees provinciales dans l'em—
pire romain, p. 54), the choice of
a native German as priest shows an
intention to make the altar “serve
as a religious and political centre
for the populations of the right
bank of the Rhine ''; afterwards for
the two provinces of Germany.

ruperat vittas: as a sign of re-
nouncing the Roman service.

rebelles: this word does not
imply rebellion, but a renewal os
war.

3. adductus: i.e. on the present
occasion. -

cum praesidio, under guard ,θ
he was treated as a prisoner, and
carried in Germanicus' triumphal

procession (Strabo, VII. p. 291).
