THIS new edition of Cicero has been treated with special reference to
the use of the orations as models of classic oratory. The Introduction ·
is made to help in this study of applied logie and rhetoric. There is a
full life of Cicero, describing his education and development as an orator,
as well as his political career. There is a chapter connecting the style of
the orations with ancient formal rhetoric. There is also a chapter on
Roman oratory and the place of the orator in ancient civilization.

The text includes the following orations: The Manilian Law, four
orations against Caffline, Archias, Milo, Marcellus, Ligarius, the four-
teenth Philippic, and eopious extracts from the Defence of Roscius and
the Actio Secunda against Verres.

Almost everything admitting of graphio presentation has an illus-
tration, and no little study has been expended in finding the most suit-
able pictures. Views of places, scenes of Roman life, and portraits have
been specially sought. Many coins are shown. The illustrations are
fully explained in the Index, with criticisms.
