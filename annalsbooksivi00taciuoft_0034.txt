m INTRODUCI'ION.

her life ended in disappointment and misery.

e. Antonia Minor, daughter of Mark Antony, the triumvir, and Octavia,
sister of Augustus; wife of the elder Drusus and mother of Germanicus. By
personal beauty, dignity and purity of character, and an abstinence from
intrigue which distinguished her from Livia and Agrippina, she deserves
to rank as perhaps the noblest example of her age of a typical Roman
matron.

which he is used. The new author seems very difficult at first,
and indeed his writings can never be called easy. But to a
greater degree than in most authors it is found that the diffi-

familiar, and cease to give trouble. These peculiarities of
Tacitus belong partly to his age, but are chiefly characteristics
of his own style.

28. The Latinity of the so-called Silver Age presents no more
contrasts with that of the Augustan Age than may be expected
in the case of any healthy language in the same space of time.
There were about one hundred and fifty years between Cicero
and Tacitus, a longer distance of time than that which separates
us from Burke, Johnson, and Gibbon. And the change in the
language, as shown by a comparison of Cicero with Quintilian
or the younger Pliny, was certainly no greater than the English
language has suffered in this interval. And the change has
been very much of the same general character,—-a change in
the direction of simplicity and naturalness. The elaborate
periods of Cicero may be compared to the ponderous and
