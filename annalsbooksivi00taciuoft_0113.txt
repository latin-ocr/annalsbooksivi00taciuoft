the sides, between the front and
rear walls of the limes.

3. incautum, unguarded,· used
as a participle, and followed by the

Ι dative of the agent.

5. expeditis, lightly equipped,·
leaving their baggage and whatever
else they could behind them.

obstantia silvarum: a partitive
genitive, nearly equivalent to obstan-
tes silvas. Intr. 35 d.

6. Marsorum: this nation, only
mentioned casually in the Germania
(2), as antiquum nomen, occupied
the country south of the Lippe,
bordering upon the Chatti. The
point reached by Germanicus is be-
lieved by Knoke (Die Feldziige des
Germanicus in Deutsclzland, 1887,
p. 30) to be Herdecke on the Ruhr.
Near this point three smaller
streams empty into the Ruhr, which
would explain the plundering in
four directions, described in the
next chapter. According to Knoke,
the Romans followed the Lippe
east for two days' march, and then
turned abruptly to the south. He
places the silva Caesia north of
Herdecke, at the end of the third
day's march, — a situation which
does not agree with Tacitus, from

whom we gather that it was trav-
ersed on the first day. Moreover,
the limes is likely to have been near
the Rhine, and parallel with it, not
with the Ruhr.

stratis: sc. Germanis.

7. neque belli timor: for the
reason given at the beginning of the
chapter— the mutiny of the legions
had thrown them off their guard.

ne pax quidem: not even the
degree of discipline and order which
is necessary in peace.

inter temulentos: Intr. 35 i.

51. cuneos, columns. In actual
fighting, the cuneus (caput porci·
num, “boar'shead,’' in soldier Latin)
was a wedge-shaped column, the
advantage of which was quia a
pluribus in unum locum tela mittun-
tur (Vegetius, 111. 19). On this
occasion, for plunder and slaughter
merely, it was probably an ordinary
column. The four columns were
probably despatched up the Ruhr
and its three branches. See note
on Marsorum, 50. 6.

quinquaginta milium: proba-
bly the space covered by the expe-
ditions.

2. non sexus, etc.: Arnold
(Deutsclze Urzez't, p. 71) remarks
