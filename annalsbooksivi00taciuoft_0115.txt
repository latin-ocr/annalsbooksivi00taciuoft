9. recentibus, its late services ,-
governed by fidens.

52. largiendis, etc.: the pay-
ment of the legacy, and shortening
of -the term of service (37. 1 and 5).

quaesivisset: the subject seems
to be taken from Germanici in the
next clause: he was vexed that
Germanicus had obtained such
glory after gaining the favor of the
soldiers by unworthy means. The
exploits were not after all very
remarkable, and one wonders how it
was known that Tiberius was vexed.

2. rettulit, laid before tlte senate
for action ; probably with a view
to the triumph voted the next year
(55. 1). Merely to lay information
before the senate is deferre.

3.· intentior, with more earnest·
ness. —fida, sincere. Velleius Pa-
terculus (II. 125), a partisan of
Tiberius, after giving only moderate
praise to Germanicus, represents
Drusus as prisca antiquaque se-

veritate usus. In fact, Drusus had
shown more decision and tact than
Germanicus, in suppressing the
mutiny.

53. Iulia: daughter of Augustus
by Scribonia3 married at the age
of fourteen to Marcellus; then, to
Agrippa, by whom she was the
mother of Agrippina and the princes
mentioned 3. 3 ; afterwards to Ti-
berius3 see note on Vipsania, 12. 6.
She was now fifty-two years old.

Pandateria: now Ventotene, in
the gulf of Gaeta.

Reginorum .- of Regium, Reggio,
at the extreme point of Italy, oppo-
site Sicily. The mention of the
people instead of the town is a sur·
vival of the primitive political con·
ception, by which the organized
community is the fundamental in-
stitution, the city or territory occu-
pied by them being only secondary,
— a point of view precisely opposite
to that of the present day.
