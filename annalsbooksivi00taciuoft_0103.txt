them the honor of sheltering their
commander's wife and child; cfss
obses Gallis, 44. 1.

42. patre: his adoptive father,
Tiberius, referred to below by il-

2. liberos: in fact, only one child
was with him.

offerrem: the protasis is im·
plied in pro gloria vestra ; I would
gladly offer them if it would sub·
serve your glory.

nunc, as z't is.

quidquid istud sceleris, what·
ever crime on your part (that is,
which, etc.). Note the characteris-

monstrative of the second person.
