’ of the consuls, with precisely equal

powers, but with specially defined
functions. See the next chapter.

4. occuleret : subjunctive of char-
acteristic.

magis: sc. even than usual.

5. intellegere, see through him.

cum: introducing a positive state-
ment of time, nearly equivalent to
and then. A. & G. 325 b.

libellum: this schedule (brevia-
rium totius imperii) was one of
three papers which were deposited
by Augustus, together with his tes·
tament, with the vestal virgins (Suet.
Oct. 101). A second contained di-
rections for his burial, the third con-
tained indicem rerum a se gestarum,
quem vellet incidi in aeneis tabulis,
quae ante Mausoleum statuerentur,
of which the well-known Monumen-
tum Ancyranum is a copy. Dio
(LVI. 33) adds τὸ πλῆθος τῶν ἐν
τοῖς θησαυροῖς χρημάτων; also, that
there was a fourth paper, contain-
ing rules and directions of govern-
ment.

6. civium sociorumque: legion·
ary troops and auxiliaries.

regna: probably countries like
Cappadocia and Mauretania, still in
name independent kingdoms‚ al-
though ready to be incorporated in
the empire as soon as the occasion
should come. Perhaps in this class
is comprised Egypt, which, although
a part of the empire, was never
reduced into the form of a province,
but was governed directly by the
emperor as a kingdom (Intr. 18. 28).

tributa. . . vectigalia: the tri·
buta were levied directly upon the
provinces, the vectigalia were in·
direct taxes, such as portoria (cus-
toms-duties) and decumae (tithes).

necessitates ac largitiones:
necessary expenses and donations.

7. terminos: the present boun·
daries. This rule of policy is men-
tioned by Dio among the contents
of the fourth document.

per invidiam: that none of his
