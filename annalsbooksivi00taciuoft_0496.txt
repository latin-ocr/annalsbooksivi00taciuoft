MOUL'roN AND COLLAR'S LATIN CoMPosrrmN, without Part
II (Part II is described on the next page), contains connected
passages based on each chapter of -the first four books of Caesar,
and on six orations of Cicero; there are also supplementary
exercises for sight tests.

While the words, idioms, and constructions required‘in translat-
ing into Latin may all be found in the text, the author has avoided
the mistake of merely putting together parts of different sentences,
taken from the text unchanged, which the pupil may hunt up and
put together without knowing the construction of the sentence.

The exercises have been carefully constructed so as to preserve
the narrative, style, and spirit of the original. The utmost care
has been taken to lead the pupil to observe, appreciate‚ and use
the proper conjunctions and pronouns which mark the transitions
from one sentence to another in Latin.

It has been the constant aim of the author to lead the pupil
to acquire a working knowledge of grammar, so that he may rely
more upon himself and less upon the teacher.

The plan has been adopted of giving numerous cross-references,
to foster the habit of comparing various passages in which a given
construction, or idiom‚ occurs, — a practice invaluable to the stu-
dent at every stage of his progreSS.
