nothing, however, openly· for Sejanus had completely gained over the
.-“ body- guard, ¹ and had brought the senators over to his support, partly by
sj ⁷ ἕδνοις, partly by hopes, partly by fears, and secured the friendship of all
the attendants of Tiberius, so that everything which the emperor said and
did was immediately reported to him, while nothing that he did was made
' known to Tiberius. 'therefore Tiberius undertook to hunt him down in
1 f· a different way, nominating him to the consulship, calling him the partner
η ’μ of his cares, repeatedly saying‘ ‘my Sejanus,'' and making a display Λα) 31
’ἒ of all th'is m letters to the senate and the people. Therefore, deceived by
, .» these expressions, and fully believing ιιι them, men erected brazen statues of .
‘D *J both alike everywhere, and coupled their names in documents, and placed
gilded chairs for them in the theatres. And finally it was voted that they
should be declared joint consuls for five years, and that a joint public
reception should be offered to them whenever they should enter Rome.
And at last they sacrificed to his statues just as to those of Tiberius.

’ ἹἹιιι5 it went with Sejanus. And many other distinguished men perished,
¹. among them Gaius Rufus Geminius.2 He, being accused of impiety against
ι, «ᾗ Tiberius, brought his will into the senate, and read it aloud, showing that
,' ,ἕ he had bequeathed his property in equal shares to the emperor and his
’ «³⁷. own children. And being taunted with his weakness, he went home before
311⁹ the vote was taken; and when he was informed that the quaestor was at
s- 3 his door to execute the judgment, he stabbed himself, and, showing him
· the wound‚ said: “Carry word to the senate that this is the way a man
dies.'' And his wife, Publia Prisca, being accused upon some charge,
ι went into the senate and there stabbed herself with a dagger which she
’ ⁹. secretly carried with her.

” . ὅ. Sejanus became so intolerably insolent in spirit and in sense of
f. power, that, to speak briefly, he seemed in good sooth to be emperor, and
’ „Tiberius a petty island king, by reason of his continually living at Capri.
There was a constant press and throng at his doors, since every one feared,
Ἴ , not merely that he would miss being seen by him, but even that he would
> 1 'not be among the first to be seen by him: for he watched everything very
closely, both words and demeanor, especially in the case of prominent
>⁴³²1 men. . . . But once on the Kalends, when a great throng was pressing
341 into the house of Sejanus, a bench in the hall 1n which he was holding a
’ξ reception broke down under the multitude of those who were sitting
λ ξ- upon it; and when he went out of the house a weasel ran through the
ἒέ crowd. And when, after sacrificing on the Capitol, he went down to the
ἔξ Forum, his servants and guards, not being able to follow him on account
