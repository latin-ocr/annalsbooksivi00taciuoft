TACITUS.

[Boox Ι.

Ad ea Drusus cum arbitrium senatus et patris obtende-

3 ret, clamore turbatur.

Cur venisset, neque augendis

militum stipendiis neque-adlevandis laboribuS, denique
nulla bene faciendi licentia? at hercule verbera et necem

4 cunctis permitti.

Tiberium olim nomine Augusti desi-

deria legionum frustrari solitum: easdem artes Drusum

5 rettulisse.

Numquamne ad se nisi filios familiarum

venturos? Novum id plane quod imperator sola militis

6 commoda ad senatum reiciat.

Eundem ergo senatum

consulendum, quotiens supplicia aut proelia indicantur ;
an praemia sub dominiS, poenas sine arbitro esse?

27 Postremo deserunt tribunal, ut quis praetorianorum mili-

tum amicorumve Caesaris occurreret, manus intentanteS‚
causam discordiae et initium armorum, maxime infensi

arbitrium . . . obtenderet: i.e.
gave as an excuse for not acting the
fact that the decision lay with them.

3. necem eunctis permitti: not
strictly true, of course, sor the death
penalty could be inflicted only by
the legatus, exercising the emperor’s
imperium.

olim: when he was their com-
mander.

4. rettulisse, repeated. It was
the same old trick, never to send a
representative who had the power
to redress grievances.

5. filios familiarum: the techni-
cal term to describe sons who were in
potestate patris, which condition
continued during the life of the
father, unless relaxed by an act of
emancipation. There is, therefore,
a tone of bitter contempt — not only
the son instead of the father, but
himself not master of himself, sui
iuris. This is of course merely an
insult, and has nothing to do with
the limitation of Drusus’ powers,
because public and private relations
were kept wholly distinct, and a
son in potestate might exercise au-

thority over his father: see the

interesting anecdote about Fabius

Maximus, Liv. XXIV. 44.

id: relates to what follows. sse
emphasis is upon commoda ; pun-
ishments and hardships he could
decide upon himself, but favors must
be referred to the Senate.

6. an, or, as if the preceding clause ’

were put in interrogative form.

sub dominis: for penes dominos.

27. ut quis . . . occurreret:
the subjunctive expresses repeated
action, the clause being connected
with what follows, —using threat-
ening gestures as they met any of
the supporters of Drusus. Only a
few of the praetorians were in the
camp; cf. 25. 1 n.

manus intentantes, threatening
(stretching their hands towards, =
shaking their fists).

causamt Intr. 35 g5 cf. 30. 1,
documentum fidei ,· 11. 64. 6, causas
bello. There are a few examples
in earlier writers (eg. Hor. Sat.
I. 4. 10, ut magnum); but the
classical writers regularly used a
relative clause in such cases. Dr'al-
