in converse, a brave soldier and an
able general, a pronounced pane-
gyrist, moreover, of the old republi-
can system, and in every respect the
most popular prince of the imperial
house.' Mommsen. He conquered
Germany, and died, B.C. 9, from a
fall with his horse.

patrui: Tiberius, his paternal
uncle by birth, but his father by
adoption. When speaking of their
natural kinship‚ Tacitus uses the
former term ; when of legal relation,
he calls them father and son.

odiis: this is the constant asser-
tion of Tacitus, but there is no evi-
dence of it in any recorded action
of Tiberius. Evidently the two men
were uncongenial to each other, but
the attitude of the emperor appears
to have been coldly just.

4. libertatern redditurus: see
II. 82; also note above. Suetonius
(Tib. 50) speaks of a letter written
by him to Tiberius, and betrayed by
the latter to Augustus, qua secum
de cogendo ad restituendam liberta·
tem Augusto agebat. There is no

doubt that he sympathized with the ’
aristocratic constitution of the Re-
public rather than the new mon-
archy3 but this incident can hardly
have been true, for it is certain that ⁷
he retained the favor and confi-

dence of Augustus to the last. ’

5. civile: this word is used to
designate acts and disposition be·
coming a citizen,-—what we may
call a republican temper.

6. muliebres offensiones: the
imperious Livia (whose favorite son
was Tiberius) had as little sympathy
with the ambitious and hot-tempered
(paulo commotior) Agrippina, as
the cold Tiberius with the genial
Germanicus.

nisi quod: there is an ellipsis
of thought here,—a violence of
temper which we should condemn,

but that, etc.; cf. Agr. 6.‚ nisi quod Ι ’

in bona uxore tanto maior laus,

quanto in mala plus culpae est.

his suite or cohort. See App. I.
Belgarum civitates: evidently

he administered the oath of alle· , ⁴
