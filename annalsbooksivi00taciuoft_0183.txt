27. Libo Drusus: in the Kal-
endar of Amiternum he is called
Marcus; both Suetonius (Tib. 25)
and Dio Cassius (LVII. 15) call
him Lucius, probably by a confusion
with his brother, the consul of the
present year (1. 1.). The family
Libo was of the Scribonian gens (e
familia Scriboniorum), but the
father of the conspirator had been
adopted by Marcus Livius Drusus,
father of the empre’ss Livia, and had

³ '2⁶³ . assumed his name. It would seem,

however, that both his sons had re-
entered the Scribonian gens, per-
haps by re·adoption; for the consul
of A.D. 16 is called Lucius Scribo-
nius Libo, and the expression (32.
2) ne quis Scribonius cognomentum
Drusi assumeret shows that Libo
Drusus was a Scribonius, not a
Livius.

The following table, from Nipper-
dey, will enable one to trace the

family: —

defertur: for the beginning of

the delationes, which were the scan-
dal of this reign, and continued to
be an abuse until the time of Domi-
tian, see Ι. 72. 3. It was the abuses
developed in this case quae per tot
annos rem publicam exedere.

2. senator: as he is not desig-
nated as consularis, praetorius, or
aedilicius, he probably received the
praetorship as a reward (32. 1); he
is, however, still called senator, A.D.
24 (IV. 31. 7).

amicitia: Intr. 35 a 3 cf. 77. 1.

inanibus: dative neuter.

Chaldaeorum, astrologers‚· ma-
gorum, magicians,· the Chal-
daeans were famed from antiquity
for their knowledge of the stars;
the magi, the priests of the Medes,
ministers of a corrupted form of the
religion of Zoroaster, readily con-
verted their religious formalities into
the practice of magic rites. In this
way the word magic came to have
its present meaning. Rome, under
the empire, swarmed with these and
other kinds of fortune-tellers.
