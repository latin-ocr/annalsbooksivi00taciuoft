Marti Concordiae, utque iduum Septembrium dies,
quo se Libo interfecerat, dies festus haberetur, L. Piso
et Gallus Asinius et Papius Mutilus et L. Apronius de-
crevere; quorum auctoritates adulationesque rettuli, ut

ceed the legitimate number of twelve
praetors. Dio, however (LVIII. 20),
says that he appointed sometimes
fifteen and sometimes sixteen. Prob-
ably the praetorship was now given
to senators who had not reached
the required age, or held the offices
which by law should have preceded
this. Pfitzner suggests that the
office was assigned to them in
advance.

2. Cotta Messalinus: son of
the distinguished orator and states-
man Messala, adopted by Aurelius
Cotta.

imago: see 27. 2 n.

Cn. Lentulus: highly praised
by Tacitus at his death: see IV.
44. 1.

cognomentum: theie are sev-
eral instances of a family agreeing
never to use a particular praenomen,
the most famous one being that of
the Manlii’, who forbade the name
Marcus on account of the treason
of Marcus Manlius (Liv. VI. 20);
so Lucius in the Claudian gens, on
account of the misdeeds of two of that
name (Suet. Tib. 1). See also III.
17. 8. That the cognomen Drusus
was prohibited in the present case,

was probably because of its asso-
ciation with the imperial family,
in the father of Germanicus and

the sons of both Germanicus and ,

Tiberius.

3. Pomponii Flacci: now con-
sul deszgrnatus. -—- L. Piso: probably
brother of Cn. Piso ; 34. 1, ΙΙΙ. 11.

1.—Gallus Asinius: see 1. 12. 4. ’ ” ’

-L. Apronius: see 1. 56. 1.

4. Concordiae ; see Orelli, 25:
pro salute Tiberii Caesaris Augusti
optimi ac iustissimi principis. For
other fragments of inscriptions
found in the ruins of the Temple
of Concord, above the · arch of
Septimius Severus, see Jordan,
T apographie der Stadt' Rom. Ι. 2.

decrevere, proposed.

vetus id . . . malum: i.e. adula—
tion: as old as the time of Tiberius,
—in the time of Tacitus this abuse
had reached a great height.

5. de mathematicis: i.e. astrolo-
gers: such votes were often passed,
but never carried out persistently.

saxo: sc. Tarpeio3 this punish-
ment was inflicted for false witness,
incest, sorcery, and perhaps other
crimes.
