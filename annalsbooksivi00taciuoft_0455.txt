23. 3. tumidis: some editors change to umidis ,· but the strength of
the winds is not so likely to be ascribed to the moisture of the country, as
to its mountainous character. ,
Α 57. 4. apertis: the manuscript reading is opertis ,· but it is plain from
what follows that the hostility was not concealed. ‚

BOOK III.

2. 1. munera fungerentur: Tacitus regularly uses munia for fime-
tions or duties, and munera for gifls: also fungor with the ablative,
Most editors, therefore, change to munia ,· but Pfitzner regards these
words as quoted from the edict of Tiberius (addito ut), who appears to
have affected an archaic style (cf. IV. 38. 1 n.). ”

3. 3.·Augusta: some editors change to Augustae ,· if the ablative is
retained, it must be explained as a peculiar use of the instrumental ablative,

“ as, by tlte example of, etc.

> 5. 6. praepositam: most editors change to propositam, on the
ground that praepono would describe 'a waxen effigy in presence of the
real body, placed upon the couch to be burned; while here the body had
been burned already, But we have seen that Tacitus does not keep very

’ · close to the facts in this passage3 and, as this term applies to the funeral

of Augustus (Dio, LVI. 34), we may suppose that the people grumbled
because the same honor was not bestowed upon Germanicus, not consider-
ing that it was impossible. ⁴

· 43. Ι. et nobilissimam: the manuscript reading is nobilissimarum,

’χ omitting et. The reading here given, that of Lipsius, is much nearest the
ι ’ ms. of all the emendations proposed, and satisfies the meaning sufficiently.

Sacrovir got the young men into his power, in order to have a hold upon

their parents. The interchange of et and ut (below) is plausible; but this
ἶ ’ ⁷ would imply that his only object in seizing the town was to get possession

of these hostages. By the reading here given, subolem is coupled with

’ί * caput, implying that his object was twofold,—to hold the capital and to

obtain the hostages.

46. 4. evincite: many editors, taking this with the meaning prove
(cf. Hor. Sat. ΙΙ. 3. 250), insert esse. But it is more natural to take it
as used by Livy (X. 17. 10), in the sense of subdue.

51. 3. decimum: this word, wanting in the manuscript, is supplied

« from Suetonius, Tib. 75: cum senatus consulto cautum esset ut poena

damnatorum in decimum semper diem dffrretur.
58. 2. duo et septuaginta annis: this is the manuscript reading.

’ The real interval was seventy-five full years, and most editors change to
2 , quinque, etc. Merula was made consul on the forced abdication of

Cinna, B.c. 87, and when Cinna returned in triumph the same year, put

⁴ ’ himself to death. From this time the office remained vacant until it was
