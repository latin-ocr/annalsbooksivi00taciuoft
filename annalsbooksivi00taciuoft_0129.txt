Rhenum iussa; Caecina, qui suum militem ducebat,
monitUS, quamquam notis itineribus regrederetur, pontes

longos quam maturrime superare.

Angustus is trames

which this neighborhood abounds.

’. ’ Those who were concealed here

formed a nova acies, which came

⁵ · to the aid of those in the plain,

when they closed their ranks and
approached the woods.

3. cohortes: of auxiliaries (as
were the equites); the legionary
troops were not brought in until
these had given way.

fugientium: the cavalry.

trudebantur: the indicative

ἶ shows that a part of them were
Ἀ Ἰ actually crowded into the swamp.

gnaram vincentibus, iniquam

ζ i nesciis: a very condensed and vig-

orous expression, illustrating Taci-
tus' remarkable ingenuity in varying
phrases. He here contrasts the ad-
vantage which came from familiarity
with the ground (gnaram), and
gave victory (vincentibus), with
the disadvantage (iniquam) to the
Romans from their ignorance of it
(nesciis).

4. manibus aequis: but evi-
dently the Romans had the worst
of it.

. legiones . . . reportat: really
on y two out of the eight. Caecina

led his four direct to the Rhine;
while the second and fourteenth
also marched by land, under Pub-
lius Vitellius (70. 1). Miiller (Philo-
logus, 33. 329) explains the contra-
diction by the supposition that the
four legions went in the fleet as far
as the Frisian coast, and that there
the ships were lightened by landing
the legions under Vitellius, —a pro-
ceeding not improbable in itself.

pars equitum: the rest were
sent on an expedition under Ster-
tinius; see 71. 1.

notis itineribus, a familiar
route, but not the one by which he
had come from the Rhine to the
Ems, because he finds the cause-
way ruptos vetustate (7), which
shows that he had not just passed
over it. Remains of a causeway
are found in the Dutch province of
Drenthe, but this seems much too
far to the north.

quarn maturrime: for sear of
pursuit.

6. L. Domitio: the grandfather
of the emperor Nero; his expedition ·

was probably B.c. 6. Cf. IV. 44. 2.
