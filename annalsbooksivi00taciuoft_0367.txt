Causam abscessus quam· 2

quam secutus plurimos auctorum ad Seiani artes rettuli,
quia tamen caede eius patrata sex postea annos pari
secreto coniunxit, plerumque permoveor num ad ipsum
referri verius sit, saevitiam ac libidinem cum* factis
promeret, locis occultantem. Erant qui crederent in 3
senectute corporis quoque habitum pudori fuisse:
quippe illi praegracilis et incurva proceritas, nudus ca-
pillo vertex, ulcerosa facies ac plerumque medicaminibus
interstincta; et Rhodi secreto vitare coetuS, recondere

voluptates insuerat.

Traditur etiam matris impotentia 4

extrusum, quam dominationis sociam aspernabatur neque
depellere poterat, cum dominationem ipsam donum eius

accepisset.

2. causam abscessus: Pistner
(L. AElius Sejanus, Landshut 1880)
points out the great advantage which
the ruler of the empire would have
in being removed from the necessity
of attending' 111 person to wearisome
details, long· continued sessions of
the senate, etc.

eius. ’Sejanus was overthrown
ΑΒ. 313 Tiberius died 37. The
reasoning is not valid, as a life of
seclusion begun by the influence of
Sejanus might have been kept up
by inertia or an acquired liking.

permoveor num: in the sense
of nescio an, I am inclined to think.

saevitiam . . . occultantem, con-
cealing by seclusion [locis] tlze cru-
elty and debauchery of which he was
guilty in ‹act,· the unusual order em-
phasizes the bad qualities.

3. corporis habitum, etc.: this

quue Augusta exprobrabat,
Profectio arto comitatu fuit : unus senator 58

description of the old man is in pain-
ful contrast with the manly beauty
displayed m the statues of Tiberius.

Rhodi: genitive, not locative.
There is very little ground for ac-
cepting the stories of a debauched
life at Rhodes, when he was in the
prime of an honorable manhood,
however it may have been at Capri,
in his debased old age.

4. impotentia, arrogance. Sue·
tonius (Tib 50 and 51) also gives
this as a cause of his retirement.

5. dubitaverat, lead conszdered
witlz hesitation, inclined, · a rare use
of dubito, but found also in the clas-
sical age (cf. Cic. Att. XII. 49. ι).

ascivit: i. e. caused his adoption
(see Ι 3 5)

reposcebat. i. e. recognition, as
of a debt or obligation.

58. arto, scanty.
