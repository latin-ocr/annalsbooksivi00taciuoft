[Boon 1.

lescentibUS, qui rem publicam interim premant, quando-

que distrahant.

Haec atque talia agitantibus gravescere valetudo Au-

2 gusti, et quidam scelus uxoris suspectabant.

Quippe

rumor incesserat, paucos ante menses Augustum, electis
consciis et confite uno Fabio Maximo, Planasiam vectum
3 ad visendum Agrippam; multas illic utrimque lacrimas
et signa caritatiS, spemque ex eo fore ut iuvenis pena-
tibus avi redderetur; quod Maximum uxori Marciae ape-

4 ruisse, illam Liviae.

Gnarum id Caesari; neque multo

post exstincto MaximO, dubium an quaesita morte, audi-

Utcumque se ea res

habuit, vixdum ingressus Illyricum Tiberius properis
matris litteris ,accitur ; neque satis compertum est, spi-

quandoque distrahant: i.e. in
their disputes for the succession,
when Tiberius should have died.
As a matter of fact, the two princes
lived in the closest intimacy and
affection, and both died before Ti-
berius. quandoque = aliquando.

5. agitantibus : Intr. 35 ο.
Some editors take it as a dative
of reference,-—also a construction
very characteristic of this writer.
Intr. 35 f. .

scelus uxoris: the current story
was that she put poison in some
figs still hanging on the tree, which
he then plucked and ate.

3. ex eo: construed with spem
(fuisse).

Marciae: she was a cousin of the
emperor, her mother Atia being a
sister of his mother.

4. gnarum = notum .-
quent usage in Tacitus. .

dubium an, perhaps ,· Tacitus
is very fond of parenthetical ex-
pressions of this kind.

quaesita (sc. a se), voluntary.

5. utcumque se ea res habuit:
the whole story is very improbable,
considering the age and infirmity of
Augustus, and the suspicions watch-
fulness of Livia.

Illyricum: this province, occu-
pying the eastern coast of the Adri-
atic Sea, had been extended by the
wars of Tiberius (B.c. 12—9) so as
to include the valleys of the Save
and Drave, by which an easy pas-
sage conducted from the Adriatic
into the valley of the Danube; it
was now divided into Upper Illyri-
cum, or Pannonia, and Lower Illy-
ricum, or Dalmatia. The latter was
afterwards extended to the Dan-
ube. The name Illyricum was, in
the later empire, given to a prae·
fecture, ot governmental district,
embracing part of Moesia, together
with Macedonia and Greece.

spirantem ε Suetonius says ( Tib.
21) that he found him still alive,
fuitque una secreto per totum

diem. So also Velleius, ΙΙ. 123.
