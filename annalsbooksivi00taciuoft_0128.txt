TACITUS.

[Boox Ι.

noscente , alienas reliquias an suorum ⁴humo tegeret,
omnes ut coniunctos, ut consanguineOS, aucta in hos-

2 tem ira, maesti simul et infensi condebant.

Primum

exstruendo tumulo caespitem Caesar posuit, gratissimo
munere. in defunctos et praesentibus doloris socius,
3 Quod Tiberio haud probatum, seu cuncta Germanici in

deterius trahenti, sive exercitum imagine caesorum ”

insepultorumque tardatum ad proelia et formidolosio-
rem hostium credebat; neque imperatorem auguratu
et vetustissimis caerimoniis praeditum attrectare feralia

debuisse.

Sed Germanicus cedentem in avia Arminium secutuS,
ubi primum copia fuit, evehi equites campumque, quem

2 hostis insederat, eripi iubet.

et propinquare silvis monitos vertit repente; mox sig-
num prorumpendi dedit iis quos per saltus occultaverat. ·

omnes: accusative.

2. gratissimo: i.e. to the sol-
diers. Notice the variety of con-
struction in the contrasts: munere,
an ablative of characteristic, being
set against socius, and in defunc-
tos corresponding to praesentibus
(Intr. 35 r). Notice, too, the loose
syntax of the whole passage.

3. seu cuncta, etc.: as usual, an
imputation of bad motives to Tibe-
rius; but, in the eyes of a genuine
votary of the Roman religion, this
was an unwarrantable pollution (see
below); Stahr maintains, moreover,
that the interruption to the cam-
paign was no slight disadvantage.

formidolosiorem: with an ob-
jective genitive only here.

attrectare, handle. It appears
from Suetonius (Cal. 2) that he
gathered the remains with his own
hands: caesorum clade Variana
veteres ac dispersas reliquias uno
tumulo humaturus, colligere sua

manu et comportare primus aggres-
sus est. This act polluted a person: .
consuetudo Romana fuit ut polluti

funere minime sacrificarent. Serv. ⁴ ’

ad Aen. XI. 2. The pollution was
greater by reason of the special
consecration of Germanicus (au-
guratu, etc.).

63. avia, tlte wilderness. Ar·
minius repeats the strategy by which
he had destroyed the army of Varus,
and nearly succeeds a second time.

evehi: i.e. from his lines ; charge.

2. colligi: reflexive.

monitos: agreeing with suos3
render actiyely, aster directing them

Intr. 3 l .
< silvis52 the Romans, still in the
forest (avia), seem to have come
upon the Germans in an open field,
campum; that it was a marshy
field is shown by the swamp, palu-
dem, into which a part of his troops
were pushed.

saltus: the wooded ravines in

Arminius colligi suos = ⁴
