ipsius veteranos non missione, non pecunia satiatos;

rabam, detraxistiS, o improvidi amici? Melius et aman-
Cecidissem certe non- 2

ducem, qui meam quidem mortem impunitam sineret,
Vari tamen et trium legionum ulcisceretur. Neque 3
enim di sinant ut Belgarum quamquam offerentium

ter to have already departed, we
must suppose that the allusion is
rhetorical, or betrays confusion of
memory.
43· 5· ,
flumina: the Rhme, upon the
borders of which they were.

43. ferrum illud: 35. 5.

melius et amantius: sc. fecit.

2. exercitui meo conscius, im-
plicated with my army. ‘As re·
sponsible for its discipline, he treats
himself as involved in what he had
not prevented.’ Furneaux.

quidem: restrictive, giving the
clause a concessive force: even if
he left my death unavenged.

Vari: the defeat of Varus was
five years before, ΑΛ). 9; and to
avenge this disaster was the special
aim of Germanicus in all his expe·
ditioris.

3. neque enim, etc.: the use of

See note on si legatos,

neque for ne, and that of ut after
sinere are extremely rare.

Belgarum: nothing is known
of this allusion. It may be that the
Belgians, as being nearest to Ger-
many, had, for their own security,
voluntarily (quamquam offeren-
tium) offered assistance after the
defeat of Varus.

claritudo: an archaic word, of
frequent occurrence in the Annals.

4. imago: used here of a men-
tal image; for it is not likely that
the legion would have an actual
image of Drusus, as some have
supposed. It is explained by tui
memoria.

istis, those of yours .· ἐφ’. of
Drusus; the soldiers who were al·
ready repentant, or who were as·
sumed by him to be so (cf. novis-
simi, 28. 7).

gloria‚ desire for glory. Cf. 8. 2 n.
