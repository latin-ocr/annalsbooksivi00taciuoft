LANGUAGE AND STYLE. xxxix

use of the participles (principally in perfect passive), both
absolute and agreeing with the subject, to connect one clause
with another, sometimes co—ordinated in sense with an infinitive,
where the English would use a succession of verbs3 eg. posito
triumviri nomine consulem se ferens . . . insurgere paulatim, he laid
aside the title of triumvir, appeared as consul, and - gradually
rose in power, L 2. 1 ; Quintilium Varum . . . cernere . . . visus est,
