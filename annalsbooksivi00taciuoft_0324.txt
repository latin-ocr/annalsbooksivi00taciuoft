magis quam libens induebat, domumque Germanici
ο revirescere occulti laetabantur. Quod principium favo-
ris et mater Agrippina spem male tegens perniciem
3 acceleravere. Nam Seianus ubi videt mortem Drusi
inultam interfectoribUS, sine maerore publico esse, ferox
scelerum, et quia prima provenerant, volutare secum
quonam modo Germanici liberos perverteret, quorum
4 non dubia successio, Neque spargi venenum in tres
poterat, egregia custodum fide et pudicitia Agrippinae
5 impenetrabili. Igitur contumaciam eius insectari, vetus
Augustae odium, recentem Liviae conscientiam exagi-
tare, ut superbam fecunditate, subnixam popularibus
studiis inhiare dominationi apud Caesarem arguerent.
6 Atque haec callidis criminatoribUS, inter quos delegerat

tantummodo velamento, quod pon·
tzficis oculos a funere arceret, — the
emperor being pontifex maximus.

2. favoris: i.e. with the people,
—popularity.

mater . . . tegens: Intr. 35 q;
the present and future participles
are very rare in this idiom; cf. Ῑ.
36. 23 IV. 34. 23 connected by et
to principium.

perniciem: for the young men,
Nero and Drusus.

3. non dubia successio: as the
children of Drusus were still very
young, those of Germanicus would
be preferred in the succession. ,

5. exagitare, excite; used with
both persons and feelings—excite
the hatred of Augusta and Livia by
the consciousness of crime; cf. Sall.
Cat. 383 Cic. Att. III. 7. 2.

inhiare . . . arguerent: it is hard
to believe that Agrippina actually en-
gaged in plots against the emperor,
—for this there could be no induce-
ment, considering his great age, the
maturity of her sons, and the infancy
of those of Drusus; the succession

would seem to have been secured
to Nero, and this was confirmed by
the acts of the emperor himself.

Nevertheless‚ with her restless and ·

ambitious temper, and his suspi-
cious disposition, it would be easy
for misunderstanding and hard feel·
ing to arise between them.

6. atque haec, etc.: this pas· ⁷

sage is variously interpreted, and is
probably corrupt. Furneaux makes
haec relate to Livia (the younger),
which is hardly possible, seeing that
the last person mentioned is Agrip-
pina; it is clear, too, that Livia was
a mere tool, and that it was Sejanus,
not she, who made use of the callidi
criminatores. Madvig corrects to
alitque3 Orelli, more probably, con-
strues haec as a neuter plural, gov-
erned by some such word as egit.
Both take Prisca as subject of
efficiebat3 but it is the agency of
Postumus, not of Prisca, that is in
question, and quia . . . valida is a
good explanation of peridoneum„
while quia . . . efficiebat is not. It
seems best to insert a comma after
