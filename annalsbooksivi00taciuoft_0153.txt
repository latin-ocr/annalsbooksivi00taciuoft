 

EXCURSUS.

,ξ the Chatti (I. 56), Germanicus set on foot an expedition on a
” large scale against the Bructeri, upon the upper Ems. While
in this region, in the neighborhood of the modern Miinster, he
conceived the plan of visiting the Teutoburg F orest, the scene
of the defeat of Varus (A.D. 9).

It is from the account of this expedition alone (I. 60) that we

learn the name of this battle-field, and it is from this passage and

II. 7 that we get our only direct information as to its situation.

,f Varus, as we learn from Dio Cassius (LVI. 18), had penetrated to
the Weser, where he seems to have remained some months in
summer quarters. Learning then of an uprising at some dis-
. *tance, he set out with his entire force, including all his baggage‚
as well as the women and children, for winter quarters upon

107

the Rhine, intending to suppress the revolt upon his way. He ‘

*1ss is likely, therefore, to have set out by the direct road, but he

had certainly left this road when he was attacked‚ for he is

represented as making his way with difficulty, even before the

attack, through a heavily wooded country, cut up with deep

· ravines, where he was obliged to cut trees to clear the way,

and 'to build bridges‚ being greatly impeded too by the slippery
nature of the soil,—there being a heavy rain and high wind.
Now, the principal military road of the Romans was by the

Δ 5 valley of the Lippe, which then as now afforded the most

direct route from the Lower Rhine into the interior of Germany.

ζ’ρ ’ On this river was the fortress Aliso, built by Drusus ; and at the

head of the river (ad caput Lupiae), Tiberius had passed one
winter, ΑΛ). 4 (Vell. Pat. II. 105). It is reasonable to suppose
that Varus marched by this road, and only left it when he

³³³³ γ arrived in the neighborhood of the insurgent tribe, which may

perhaps have been, as Knoke suggests, the Bructeri.

From Tacitus we learn two important facts. F irst, that the
scene of the disaster was upon the Lippe; for the Germans
who were besieging a fort upon this river (ΙΙ. 7) retired at the
approach of Germanicus, first, however, destroying the mound
which he had erected on the battle-field the previous year
