space in his works have an individuality of character which
seems to pervade all their words and actions. We know them
as is we had lived with them.”

34. This dominant characteristic as an historian serves to
explain one of his most conspicuous characteristics of style, —
fondness for poetical words and phrases, and especially his
close relation to Vergil. Vergil, too, wasa writer of a lofty
ethical tone, and was evidently a favorite with Tacitus, who, as
has been often· pointed out, copies freely his phrases and turns
of speech. So marked is* his predilection for poetical words
and phrases, that it is hard to say whether his style borrows
more from the poets or from the habits of speech of the foren-
sic orator. On the whole, it is only m his diction that he has
borrowed from the poets; ·ih s abruptness and compression of
style, his sententiousness and earnestness, are qualities that he
has brought from the·court-room. This explains a tendemess
of feeling which often goes>⁸ to the length of sentimentality3 in
treating of Tiberius, for example, he persistently depicts stern
justice as harshness‚ economy as niggardliness (ΙΙ. 38), modesty
asmeanness of spirit (IV. 38), and a peaceful and sels-contained
policyas a degenerate temper (ΙΙ. 26; IV. 32). ¹

35·- The grammatical and stylistic peculiarities of Tacitus are
for the most part such as show the influence of the poets· on
the working of a poetic temperament. If, as has been said
above, the student who passes from Cicero to‘Tacitus meets
with much that is strange and difficult, the student of Vergil
finds himself often on familiar ground. Most of thesepeculi-
arities will be pointed out in the notes 3 but it will be of service
to enumerate here a few of the most striking and characteristic
of them, passing over in general those which may be called reg-
ular if unusual forms of expression. It should be noted that
most of the usages here pointed out are rather characterzlctics
than· peculiarities of Tacitus; that is, they are found also in
other writers, but are especially common with him.
