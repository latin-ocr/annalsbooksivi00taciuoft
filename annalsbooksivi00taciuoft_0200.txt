as he lived, Tiberius had no pros-
pect of the throne.

4. versa = eversa (Intr. 35 b).
With the death of Gaius and his
brother Lucius, and the murder of
Agrippa Postumus, the family of Au-
gustus became extinct in the male
line, and the succession passed to
his step-son Tiberius. See Ι. 3. 3.

5. si intellegere crederetur: the
apodosis is implied in vim metuens.

immiti: a case of enallage, the
adjective, agreeing with principe,
being put for the adverb.

non ob, etc.: construed with fi-

crimina: Dio Cassius (LVII. 17.

being so weak (fessus senio) that

aequa: to be treated like a

tesimam partem).

7. Antiocho: his kingdom, Com-
magene, lying north of Syria, was,
as appears from 56. 5, annexed to
the empire. It became a part of the
province of Syria; but after twenty
years its independence was restored
by Caligula.

Philopatore: he ruled over the
eastern part of Cilicia, lying be·
tween Commagene on the east and
the Roman province of Cilicia on
the west.

Iudaea: this country, conquered

by Pompey, B.C. 64, was reckoned a ν
