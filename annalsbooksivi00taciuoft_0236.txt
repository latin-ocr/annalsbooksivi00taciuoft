the younger Drusus (JV. 9. 2),
Lucius Verus, and perhaps Caracalla
(Marquardt, R‘o‘m. Staatsverfl 111.
420).

sedes curules, etc.: a curule
seat at the theatre was a special
honor highly esteemed, which had
been granted to Julius Caesar and to
Marcellus after his death, and was
now bestowed upon the whole col-
lege to which Germanicus had be-
longed (1. 54. 2). The oaken
wreath was a reward of civil dis-
tinction3 those here described were
made of precious materials (δίαλιθον

καὶ διάχρυσον. Dio, XLIV. 6. 3).

4. iustitio: see Ι. 16. 2 n.

5. nihil compositum: no for-
mal arrangements.

7. ut quisque obvius (sc. est
negotiatoribus): equivalent to
quicumque obvius est, subject of
transfert understood. ⁴

8. moliuntur . . . fores: which
had been closed for the night.

tempore ac spatio: a hendia-
dys, in tlte course qs time.

83. 2. Saliari carmine: the
Salii, special priests of Mars, were a
very ancient collegium, membership
in which was reserved for men of
high rank. Their chant had come

down from high antiquity, and was
scarcely intelligible. Of those who
received the honor of having their
names inserted in this hymn, we
know only of Germanicus, probably

effigies: of Germanicus.

praeiret: in the sacred wagon
(tensa), along with the images of
the gods.

flamen: sc. Augustalis.
