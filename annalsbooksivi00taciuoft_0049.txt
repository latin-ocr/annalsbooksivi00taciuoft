the leaders of the opposite party
—Brutus, Cassius, the Pompeys—
had perished before. Now, by the
death of Antony, the party of Caesar,
too, was reduced ,to a single leader.

Caesar: Gaius Octavius (the em·
peror Augustus), great-nephew of
Julius Caesar, was adopted by him,
and took his name, Gaius Julius
Caesar. To distinguish him from his
great-uncle, he is commonly known
as Octavianus; in his own time,
however, he was simply Gaius Caesar.

posito triumviri nomine: see
note on potentia, 1. 3. Augustus
never formally laid down his author-
ity until B.c. 27. He was trium-
vir from 42 to 33, consul in the year
31, and every year after until 23.
For the year 32, therefore, he had no
legal authority, unless as triumvir.
Mommsen, therefore (Staatsreclzt‚
11‘. 676), concludes that he continued
to act as triumvir after the second
term had expired, and that it was
only by an afterthought that, in the
Monumentum Ancyranum (4. 1)
he says, συνεχέσιν ἔτεσιν δέκα (cf
Sueton. Oct. 273 triumviratum rei
publicae constituendae per decem
annos administravit). According
to Mommsen, an officer appointed
for revising the constitution was not
held to any term: certainly Antony
did not lay down his office at the
