έ- him rose up ; having before been most eager to make him their friend,
ἶ now they would not even sit on the same seat with him. And at this the
praetors and tribunes gathered about him, in order that he might not rush
out and make a disturbance, which he would certainly have done if the
. full weight of the accusation had fallen upon him at first. But as it was
.· read, looking upon each separate point as trivial and isolated, and espe-
[ ζ ciaUy hoping that there would be nothing further, or if there should be
' that at any rate nothing fatal would be brought against him, he hesitated
' and remained in his place. And then Regulus summoned him, but he
did not obey, not out of insolence, for he was already completely broken
down, but because he was not accustomed to have orders given to him.
Then after he had called him a second and a third time, the consul
’ stretched out his hand towards him and said, ‘⁴ Sejanus, come hither.’'
At this he answered in these very words, “Is it Ι that you are calling?'’
[ἐμὲ καλεΐς;]; and when he stood up, Laco came up and stood by him.
And at last, when the letter had been read through, all with one voice
cried out against him, and reviled him—some because they had suffered
wrongs from him, and others out of fear, some trying to conceal their
former friendship for him, and others rejoicing at his downfall. But
Regulus did not call upon them all to speak, and indeed he did not call
Δ upon any one to speak in regard to putting him to death, for he feared
that some opposition would be made, and some disturbance excited (for
Sejanus had many relatives and friends): but he took the opinion of a
certain senator, and, finding that he agreed with him that he should be
imprisoned, he led him out of the senate, and with Laco and the other
magistrates conducted him to the prison.

11. And now might one witness human weakness‚ and learn to abjure
arrogance. He who that very morning had been attended to the senate-
house by great numbers, as being raised above all, was now haled into
prison, having fallen far below all3 he who before had been deemed worthy
of garlands was now put in chains3 he who, as a ruler, had been surrounded
with guards, was now watched like a runaway'slave; he who had been
clad in purple was now buffeted in the face ; he who had been reverenced,
and had received sacrifice like a god, was now led to death. . . . The
people also assaulted him and upbraided him with the fate of those whom
he had ruined, and taunted him with the failure of his hopes. All his
statues they cast down, and broke in pieces, and dragged about as if they
were tormenting him in person3 and thus he became witness of what he
was about to suffer in person. For then he was cast into prison ; but not
long after, indeed the very same day, the senate, assembling in the temple
of Concord, close by the prison, when they saw these actions of the people,
