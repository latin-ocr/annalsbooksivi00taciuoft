been likely to add oppidum or cas·
tellum, as with Aliso in the last
chapter. It cannot correspond with
the modern town of Emden‚ which
is on the right bank. Most editors
insert ore ,· but it is likely that
Germanicus made use of the boats
which were built expressly for river
navigation. It is true he is criti-
cised for not conveying his troops
by water further than he did, but

> this may be explained by suppos-

ing, with Knoke, that his original
intention had been to sail up the
Hase or some other confluent of
the Ems. This would explain the
emphatic position of Amisiae, ——
the fleet was left in the Ems, on its
lefl bank. The narrative shows that
the place where he landed was still
under the influence of the tides. It
appears, moreover, from 23. 1, that
on his return he conveyed his troops
in ships per flumen Amisiam - from
which it is probable that he left the
fleet¹ some way up the river.

pontibus: it is possible that he
bujlt more than one bridge for so
large an army, but more likely that
the plural is used for the singular,
—a bridge of several arches or
divisions.

3. aestuaria: the flats along the

river, flooded at high tide. We
have in this chapter more even than
the usual abruptness and compres-
sion. It is clear, however, that the
sudden rise of the tide was while
the army was marching up the right
bank of the river.

artem . . . ostentant: the Ba-
tavians, living in a country of rivers
and lakes, were expert swimmers.

turbati, ete.: τῖε. by a sudden and
rapid rise of the tide.

4. metanti castra: another vio-
lent transition. The passage from
the Ems to the Weser is not men-
tioned, and must be supplied in
mind either here or at the end of
the chapter. The present place is
the most probable, because the es-
tablishment of the camp at the end
of the march, when in the neigh-
borhood of the enemy, would be
much more important, and more
likely to receive special mention
than any of the encampments along
the road. Moreover, the words at
the beginning of the ninth chapter
show that the army was already
upon the Weser, and cannot be
conjoined with what goes immedi-
ately before, except by understand·
ing that the camp here laid out was
on or near this river.
