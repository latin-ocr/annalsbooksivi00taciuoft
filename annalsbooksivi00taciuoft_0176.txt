varii, it would seem that they were
marching towards the north 3 but
we have no other positive clew to
the position, and do not even know
what river is referred to. Knoke
points to Leese, a few miles north
of Minden, on the east bank of the
Weser, where the remains of an
earthwork have been found, con-
necting the river with a marshy
plain, which in the time in question
must have been covered with woods.
The ground here answers completely
to the description (as may fifty other
places in the region); and an in-
teresting piece of supplementary
evidence is a heap of small stones
of equal size, artificially flattened on
two sides, which would seem to be
such as were hurled by the libritores,
mentioned in the next chapter. He

appended plan, from Knoke, gives
the localities in question, and will
assist in understanding the manoeu-
vres, even if the correctness of his
view cannot be absolutely estab-
lished. The German line ran, ac·
cording to him, from the agger at
Leese, southeasterly to the Rehburg
hills, their centre being at Diissel-
burg. The Romans approached
from the plains south of Loccum.

Sejanus ; he had perhaps taken the
place of Apronius (see I. 56. 1). He
was to operate in the open ground,

the cavalry, who were in the wooded
hills.

German cavalry could have fallen

engaged by Tubero. The ground
being level (plana) the advance
here was made easily.
