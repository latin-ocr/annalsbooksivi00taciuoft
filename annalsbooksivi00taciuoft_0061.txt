ANNALS.

re publica videretur quam per uxorium ambitum et senili

adoptione inrepsisse.

ciendas etiarn procerum voluntates inductam dubitatio-
nem; nam verba vultus in crimen detorquens recondebat.

Nihil primo senatus die agi passus nisi de supremis 8
Augusti, cuius testamentum inlatum per virgines Vestae

Tiberium et Liviam heredes habuit.

Livia in fami-

liam Iuliam nomenque Augustum adsumebatur; in
spem secundam nepotes pronepotesque, tertio gradu
primores civitatis scripserat, plerosque‘invisos sibi, sed
iactantia gloriaque ad posteros, Legata non ultra civilem
modum, nisi quod populo et plebi quadringentiens triciens

uxorium, etc.: the influence ex-
erted upon the aged Augustus by
his wife Livia.

11. inductam, put on, assumed.

verba, vultus: of others.

recondebat, store up, lay up,
as a grudge. Tacitus' explanation of
facts and imputation of motives
must not be accepted as of equal
authority with his statements of
fact. (Intr. 13.) Hesitation and
indecision were prominent traits of
character in Tiberius, and may per-
haps afford a sufficient explanation
of his demeanor on this occasion.

8. per virgines Vestae: it
was common to depositwi113,trea-

, ties, etc., in temples, and especially

with the Vestal virgins. Caesar’s
will was deposited with them.

heredes: Tiberius two thirds‚ ex
parte dimidia et sextante, Livia one
third, as we learn from Suetonius,
Oct. 101.

2. Augustum: an adjective.
From this time she is regularly
known as Augusta.

in spem secundam = secundos
heredes .· Drusus, son of Tiberius,
one-third, Germanicus and his male
children ex partibus reliquis. This

appointment of second aad third

heirs was to take effect only in de-
sault of first heirs, or in case the first
heirs should fail to qualify, cernere ,-

· for the heir had the option of de-

clining the inheritance.

primores: sc. quosdam. Sue·
tonius says propinquos amicosque
complures.

gloria, love ofglory.

3. civilem: becoming a private
citizen.

quadringentiens triciens quin-
quiens: this is given by Suetonius
as two separate legacies, legavit
populo Romano quadringenties, tri-
bubus tricies quinquies sestertium
(Oct. 101), tribubus being used by
him as equivalent to Tacitus’ plebi.
This is usually explained as meaning
that quadringentiens [sc. centena
milia sestertium] z 232,000‚000
went into the treasury, while trici-

ens quinquiens, 3175000, was dis· ¹

tributed viritim. It is hard to un-
derstand, if this is the case, why
Tacitus should give them as one
legacy; moreover, three and a half
million sesterces divided among the
200,000 persons entitled to gratui-
ties would make the paltry sum of
17} sesterces=87{ cents apiece,
while it is known from Dio Cassius
