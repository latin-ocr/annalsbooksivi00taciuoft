TACITUS.

[Boon I.

Candidatos praeturae duodecim nominavit, numerum
ab Augusto traditum; et hortante senatu ut augeret,

15 iure iurando obstrinxit se non excessurum.

Turn pri-

murn e campo comitia ad patres translata sunt; narn
ad eam diem, etsi potissima arbitrio principis, quaedam

2 tamen studiis tribuum fiebant.
turn ius questus est nisi inani rumore, et senatus largi· J

Neque populus ademp—

tionibus ac precibus sordidis exsolutus libens tenuit,

II. 1051. He had not yet received
the tribunician power.

5. designatus consul: this is
usually explained as meaning that,
as consul designatus, he must. have
voted first in his own case. Fur—
neaux, however, is of opinion that
this objection might have been
waived (cf. ΙΙΙ. 22. 6), and that the
real reason was that the proconsular
imperium, which belonged exclu-
sively to the provinces, would for
any but the prince himself have
been inconsistent with the purely
civic office of consul, which he was
to hold the next year.

6. candidatos duodecim . .
nominavit: this was the whole
number of praetors to be elected3
and, as this nominationis contrasted
with the absolute right of appoint-
ing (commendation) four praetors,
sine repulsa et ambitu, described a
few lines below, it follows that it
had in law only the force of testing
qualifications and admitting to can-
didacy. That the presiding magis-
trate, the consul, had exactly the
same power, of admitting to can·
didacy‚ is shown (in relation to the
consulship) by 81. 3: posse et alios
prcfiteri: of course, however, a
nomination by the emperor was in
most cases equivalent to an elec-
tion. The proposition of the Senate
that he should nominate more than
twelve (ut augeret) would really
have the effect of limiting the em-

peror's power, inasmuch as there
would then be an actual selection
from among his candidates.

obstrinxit: used absolutely -“-·

bound himself,· cf. IV. 31. 5, and ⁴

flexit, 13. 6.

15. ecampo . . . translata
sunt: this refers only to the elec·
tion of praetors3 the consuls con-
tinued in form to be elected by the
people at least until the time of .
Vespasian. (Momm. R'o'm. St. ΙΙ.

865.) Velleius (ΙΙ. 124) speaks of ’

this as ordinatio comitiorum, quam

manu sua scriptam divus Augustus .

reliquerat. The place for holding ⁷
the comitia was the Campus Mar· ·
tius. Velleius (II. 126) says of
this: revocata in fhrum fides, sum-
mota e foro seditio, ambitio campo,
discordia curia.

potissima, the most important .·
although the elections were free,

Augustus made use of nomination Ἴ

where he thought fit.
tribuum: i.e. the people as or-

ganized in tribes. It will be remem- ³]

bered that the tribal organization
was not confined to the tribal assern-
blies, but that the centuries also were .
grouped by tribes in the reformed v >
comitia centuriata, as re-organized .
between the First and Second Punic
Wars. Suetonius says of Augustus
(Oct. 56), firebat et ipse suffragium
in tribubus, ut unus e populo.

2. senatus: because all the im-
portant magistracies must be held by
