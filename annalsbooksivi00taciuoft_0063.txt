A.D. 14] ANNALs. 17

signes ut porta triumphali duceretur funus, Gallus Asi-
nius, ut legum latarum tituli, victarum ab eo gentium
vocabula anteferrentur, L. Arruntius censuere. Addebat 5
Messalla Valerius renovandum per annos sacramentum in
nornen Tiberii; interrogatusque a Tiberio, num se man-

, dante eam sententiam prompsisset, sponte dixisse re-

spondit, neque in iis quae ad rem publicam pertinerent

ν consilio nisi suo usurum, vel cum periculo offensionis : ea

sola species adulandi supererat. Conclamant patres 6
corpus ad rogum umeris senatorum ferendum. Remisit
Caesar adroganti moderatione, populumque edicto monuit
ne, ut quondam nimiis studiis funus divi Iulii turbassent,
ita Augustum in foro potius quam in campo MartiS, sede
destinata, cremari vellent. Die funeris milites velut prae· 7
sidio stetere, multum inridentibus qui ipsi viderant

³ Α quique a parentibus acceperant diem illum crudi adhuc

servitii et libertatis improspere repetitae, cum occisus
dictator Caesar aliis pessimum, aliis pulcherrimum fa-

porta triumphali: this gate is
usually asserted to have been be-
tween the Capitoline and the Tiber.
Jordan, however (T apographie der
Stadt Rom. 1. p. 240, n. 76) holds
that it was a mere fornix or arch,
on the Campus Martius.

Gallus Asinius: a son of the
eminent orator Asinius Pollio. The
practice of putting the cognomen be-
fore the nomen was common under
the empire. In this case the prae-
nomen was regularly omitted.

latarum ε sc. ab Augusto.

5. interrogatusque, etc.: Tibe-
rius steadily declined ostentatious
and adulatory honors, at least in
the early years of his reign.

ea: the show of independence.

6. umeris senatorum: Sulla was
the first who received this honor.

remisit, excused (cf. ΠΙ. 55. 1).

This does not mean that he pro-
hibited it, and we learn from Sue-
tonius and Dio that the proposition
was carried out.

turbassent: the speech of Mark
Antony at Caesar's funeral so fired the
people that they broke to pieces the
benches, and burned the body of
Caesar in the forum.

sede destinata: Augustus had
built a mausoleum for himself and
his family upon the Campus Mar-
tius, the remains of which may be
still seen. It was a circular build-
ing, and was surrounded with pleas-
ure grounds: inter Flaminiam
viam ripamque Tiberis . . .,· cz'r-
cumiectasque silvas et ambulationes
in usum populi iam tum publica-
rat. Suet. Oct. 100. [lute.

7. inridentibus: ablative abso·

occisus dictator: Intr. 35 q.
