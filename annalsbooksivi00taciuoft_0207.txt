48. in publicum, of a public
character. It cannot be intended
to contrast the liberality of the state
with that of Tiberius as an indi-

ἶ , vidual, because, although the remis-

sion of tribute was made by the

’ ’ senate, the gift of ten million ses-
. terces was made by the emperor

himself. ΤΙιε next case was one of

Ξῖ ’ private necessity.

Aemiliae Musae. probably a

²2³5 libertina, or freedwoman. As her

property was to go to the fiscus, it

would seem probable that she not
' . only had no heirs, but that even her
was uncertain 3 the ·

kinship of Aemilius Lepidus was
not certain (videbatur). He is

⁴ probably the one who is called (ΙΙΙ.
⁴ , 32. 2 and 72. 3) inops and pecuniae

modicus.
Aemilio Lepido: dative after

’ ’ tradidit.

in parte. it was common to as-

* sociate the emperor with the legiti-

 

mate heirs; Augustus is said in this
way to have inherited, in the last
twenty years of his life, about 370,-
ooo,ooo (Suet. Oct. 101). Cf. Tac.
Agric. 43.

prioribus . . . tabulis, an earlier
will. Wills might still be made
orally, but were regularly written on
waxen tablets, which were then tied
together and sealed.

scripturn: i.e. as sole heir.

nobilitatem, etc.: showing that
his reluctance in the case of Horta·
lus (38) was on the ground of un·
worthiness3 see below.

2. nuncupantes: this word, orig·
inally meaning to name the heir
orally 1n the presence of witnesses,
appears to be used here for any
form of appointment, as in Pliny
(Paneg. 43), nec quia cffindit alius
nuncuparis, sed quia ipse meruisti.

JQ. Vitellium. an uncle of the
emperor, and brother of Publius
Vitellius (Ι. 70.1); cf. Suet. Vit. 2.
