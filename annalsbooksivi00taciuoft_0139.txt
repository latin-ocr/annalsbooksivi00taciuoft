” ² veteres idem, sed alia in iudicium veniebant: si quis pro·
” ditione exercitum aut plebem seditionibuS, denique male
gesta re publica, maiestatem populi Romani minuisset:
facta arguebantur, dicta impune erant. Primus Augustus 4
cognitionem de famosis libellis specie legis eius tractavit,
commotus Cassii Severi libidine, qua viros feminasque
illustres procacibus scriptis diffamaverat3 mox TiberiuS,
consultante Pompeio Macro praetore an iudicia maies—
tatis redderentur, exercendas leges esse respondit. Hunc 5

low. The “treason trials'' of the mum est in eo et acerbitas mira, et

reign of Tiberius afford the most
serious of the charges against him.
But in the first years of his reign,

³ , the trials were according to the

 

regular judicial procedure, and the
emperor made constant efforts to
mitigate the severity of the law.
(Intr. 15 and 16). sse govern-
ment, it must be remembered, was
still a republic in form, and the sen-
ate had legal authority in these cases.
Certainly it was by the direct order
of Tiberius that the laws were en-
forced3 see below, 4

faeta arguebantur: just as, in
English and American law, charges
of constructive treason are by strict
right excluded, but have neverthe-
less 'been often resorted to in times
of peril and excitement.

4. famosis libellis: according
to Suetonius (Oct. 55), id modo cen-
suit, cognoscendum posthac de iis qui
libellos aut carmina ad infamiam
cuiuspiam sub alieno nomine edant.
According to Cicero (ad Fam. 111.
ΙΙ. 2), maiestas was extended by
Sulla, ne in quemvis impune decla-
mari liceret.

Cassii Severi: Quintilian says
of him (X. 1. 117),ingenii pluri-

urbanitas eius summa ,· sed plus
stomacho quam consilio dedit. Cf.
IV. 21. 5. ,

mox, afterwards ,· its usual mean-
ing in Tacitus.

Pompeio Macro: for his fate,
see VI. 18. 4.

praetore: the one who presided
over the quaestio de maiestate. The
accuser had the option of bringing
the charge before one of these
courts, presided over by a praetor,
or the senate, presided over by the
consul. See ΙΙ. 79. 2. sse senate,
however, could decline to take cog-
nizance of them3 cf. IV. 21. 3 and 4.
See Mommsen, Ro‘m. St, II. 105.

exercendas leges: Suetonius
(Tib. 58) tells the same story, add-
ing, et atrocissime exercuit. Pliny
(Paneg. 11) says, dicavit caelo T i-
berius Augustum, sed ut maiestatis
crimen induceret.

5. hunc quoquez as well as
Augustus.

carmina: Suetonius (Tib. 59)
gives some examples of these; eg„
Fastidit vinum, quia iam sitit iste
cruorem .· tam bibitkunc avide quam
bibit ante merum. See also IV. 42.

discordem, etc.: see Intr. 26 a.
