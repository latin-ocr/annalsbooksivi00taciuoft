erat oratoris Hortensii, illectus a divo Augusto liberali-

arcana imperii: by interfering
with the details of administration,
which were reserved to the emperor
and his privy council. One of the
principles of the imperial govern-
ment was the withdrawal of the
military authority from the senate,
and its concentration in the hands
of the emperor.

quasi, etc.: ef. Ι. 14. 6 n.

differre: i.e. in quinquennium.

3. mens, sentiment (loyalty,
etc.); domus, family connections:
fortuna, means ,· all of these might
change in the course of five years.

4. honorem: as magistratus de-
signatus. The consul elect ranked
above the consulares, and was asked
his opinion (sententia) in the senate
before them; and so with the other
magistracies. To enjoy this dignity
for five years would excite arrogance
and give rise to complications.

5. leges: the laws which fixed
the age at which the several magis-
tracies could be held, their order,
and the intervals of time which
must elapse between them.

vim imperii tenuit: he kept in
his hands the substance of power.

cf. Vell. Pat. ΙΙ. 129: senatorum
censum . . . quam libenter supplevit,
ut neque luxuriam invitaret, neque
honestam paupertatem pateretur digr-
nitate destitui.

accepisset: the thought of those
who felt surprise.

2. oratoris Hortensii: the ora-
tor, the rival of Cicero, but older
than he, and opposed to him in the
case of Verres. Hortensius was dis-
tinguished for prodigality and luxury,
hence no doubt in part the poverty
of the family ; his son, father of this
Hortalus, had gone over from the
