5. alia, changed.

· si legatos. there seems to be a
confusion 1n the writer' s mind. The
senatorial legati were already sasely
·on their way home (39. 8), and no
imprisonment of legionary legati
has been mentioned. The phrase
-includi legatos (42. 7), as well as
'the present expression, are— so far
as our knowledge goes —- merely
rhetorical.

imperatori, tlte emperor.

turbidos: the ringleaders (se-
ditiosissimum quemque, 44. 3),
who are not to be admitted to
repentanee.

44. alumnus: the youthful
Caligula was a camp pet.

2. reditum: the accusative is
regularly used with excuso to desig-
nate the person or the act apolo-
vgized for; here it denotes the thing
that she was excused from doing.

partum: nothing is known of

any child of Agrippina born this λ ,·
·year; if there was a'ny, it must have

been short· lived.

exsequerentur: a hint for the
massacre which followed.

3. vinctos: a plural adjective
with a collective noun is rare be-
fore Livy.

legatum legionis primae: until
the Gallie campaigns of Caesar the
legion was commanded by its six
tribunes. Caesar detailed one of his
legati to the command of each
legion, and from this time the
legatus legionis was the regular
commander of the legion, until
superseded in the second century
by the praefectus castrorum (see
note, 20. 1).

4. pro contione, in the manner
of a public meeting. The camp
had a forum in front of the tribunal
(18. 4 n.)‚ where the soldiers were
addressed by their* commander.
