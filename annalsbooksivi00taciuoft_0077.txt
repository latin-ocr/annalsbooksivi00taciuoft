quis tot casus vita superaverit, trahi adhuc diversas in

Enimvero militiam ipsam 6

gravem infructuosam: denis in diem assibus animam
et corpus aestimari; hinc vestem arma tentoria, hinc
saevitiam centurionum et vacationes munerum redimi.

paucis, etc.: there were six tri-
bunes and sixty centurions to a
legion. >

3. ignavia peccatum: they had
lost their rights by their own negli-
gence.

tricena aut quadragena: the

J' regular time of service for legiona-

ries was twenty years; for praetori-
ans, sixteen. At the end of this
time they were entitled to honorable
dismissal, honesta missio, with a
bounty3 but they were generally

obliged, even after this discharge

(dimissis), to continue in service as
a privileged body of veteratis, vete-
rani‚-known also as vexillarii
(apud vexillum) from the stand-
ards, vexilla, to which each corps
was attached.

4. eosdem labores: this is an ex·
aggeration, for they were exempted
from the heaviest duties, such as
foraging, trenching, etc.

5. adhuc = insuper.

·⁷ , aestateS, bellum atrox aut sterilem pacem sempiterna.

per nomen agrorum ε the grants
of land made to vetet-ans at their
discharge by way of bounty. The
distance and worthlessness of these
lands, they asserted, made the bounty
more of a burden than a benefit
to them, and they would have pre·
ferred bounties in cash‚ such as had
formerly been given (isdem in
castris praemium pecunia sol-
veretur).

uligines paludum: Intr. 35 d.

6. denis assibus: the as was
worth about a cent. -

vestem arma tentoria: sc. emi,
implied in redimi by a kind of
zeugma. These the soldier was
obliged to purchase out of his pay3
food he seems to have received.

vacationes munerum, fur-
loughs. redimi is used in a differ-
ent sense with the two subjects,—
buyz'ngoff the cruelty by buying fur-
loughs; cf. Hist. I. 46: locuple-
tissimus quisque miles labore ac
