' and Tiberius might have been par-

3. studia . . . Agrippinam: the

ἦ · suspicion of Agrippina’s loyalty,
. which led to such tragic results, may

have begun now; but even before

the emperor appears to have felt

some uneasiness (see Ι. 69. 4).
solum Augusti sanguinem:

5 .⁴ she was the only descendant of
ἶ .‘ Augustus living, except her dissolute
ζ , sister Julia (see 24. 2).

integram . . . precarentur: the

⁴, partial fulfilment of this prayer, in
τ’ ζᾞ the survival of Caligula and the
ς, , younger Agrippina, brought no good
ἶ to the people.

ὅ. requirerent, missed.

Ticinum: the modern Pavia.

circumfusas . . . imagines: re-
ferring to the great number of these.
Other samilies (as the Livii) must
also have been represented. Drusus,
having never been adopted into
the Julian gens, was not properly
entitled to its imagines, but the,
rule was probably relaxed in his
favor: He died B. C. 9 from a fall of
his horse in the heart of Germany.

laudatum pro rostris: the fu-
neral oration, by some near relative,
was an essential part of the cere-
mony.

cuncta: i.e. ceremonies of honor.

4. sane: that is, this could not
have been avoided. These first
ceremonies (prima) chance had
made informal.
