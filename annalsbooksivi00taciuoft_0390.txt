344 TACITUS. ff [Boon v. «

[Tiberius] , although he himself was intimate with Syriacus} And he did ·
not disclose this to Gallus, but treated him with great honor, so that there
befell him the strangest fate, such as never happened to any other person.
For on the very same day that he banqueted with Tiberius and drank his = q
health, he was condemned to death by the senate, and a praetor was sent  
to put him in chains and conduct him to punishment. And yet Tiberius,
after he had done this, would not allow him to die, much as he wished it ,
when he learned what had been voted3 but, in order that he might suffer Ἰ
to the utmost‚ bade him be of good courage, and ordered him to be kept ’
guarded, but without fetters, until he himself should come to the city, in ⁵
. order, as I have said, that he might be tormented as much as possible by ’ῃ
shame and dread. And this is what happened: he was constantly watched v
by whoever were consuls for the time being (that is, except when Tiberius j
held the consulship, for then he was guarded by the praetors), not for sear
he would escape, - no, by Zeus, but to prevent his death. He had neither ¹
friend nor slave with him, nor did he speak to any one or see any* one
except when he was forced to take food. And this was such, in amount
and quality, as neither to give him pleasure nor strength, but just to keep -
him alive3 for this was the most dreadful thing of all.2
Tiberius did the same to many others. Having thrown one of his friends ξ
in prison, then, when the question came up of putting him to death, he ’ ’
said that he was not yet reconciled with him. In the case of another, ν’
whose innocence he had ascertained after having tortured him very se· ,Ῐ ’
verely, he put him to death immediately, saying that after having suffered ,-
such indignities he could not honorably continue in life. 'Syriacus too, s*
although he had neither committed any crime nor been accused of any,
and was distinguished for culture, was executed‚ merely because Tiberius Ῐζ
said that he was a friend of Gallus. ’
Sejanus also slandered Drusus3 by means of his wife. For, having ,
intrigues with nearly all' the wives of the principal men, he learned every· Ῑ
thing that was done and said by them, making the women his tools by ‚
promising to marry them. But when Tiberius only sent Drusus to Rome, ι
SejanuS, fearing that he might change his mind, persuaded Cassius to bring
charges against him. ἡ
4. Now Sejanus constantly became more powerful and formidable, so ⁷
that the senate and the citizens paid court to him as if he were emperor,
and even treated Tiberius with contempt. Thfflefore Tiberius, becoming ’
aware-of this, did not regard it with indifference, nor yet did he neglect it; ε
for he feared that they would declare him emperor outright. He did ζ
