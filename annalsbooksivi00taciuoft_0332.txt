TACITUS.

[Boox IV.

Caesar: solitum quippe magistratibus diem privatis di-
cere; nec infringendum consulis iuS, cuius vigiliis ni-
teretur ne quod res publica detrimentum caperet.
3 Proprium id Tiberio fuit scelera nuper reperta priscis

verbis obtegere.

Igitur multa asseveratione, quasi aut

legibus curn Silio ageretur aut Varro consul aut illud

4 res publica esset, coguntur patres,

Silente re0, vel si

defensionem coeptaret‚ non occultante cuius ira preme-
retur, conscientia belli Sacrovir diu dissimulatus, victoria

5 per avaritiam fOedata et uxor Sosia arguebantur.

Nec

dubie repetundarum criminibus haerebant, sed cuncta
quaestione maiestatis exercita, et Silius imminentem

20 damnationem voluntario fine praevertit. Saevitum tamen

in bona, non ut stipendiariis pecuniae redderentur, quo-
rum nemo repetebat, sed liberalitas Augusti avulsa,

2 computatis singillatim quae fisco petebantur.

Ea prima

Tiberio erga pecuniam alienam diligentia fuit.
Sosia in exsilium pellitur Asinii Galli sententia, qui

(Intr. 16), the prosecution by a
high magistrate would carry more
weight than by a private citizen.

diem dicere: the technical ex-
pression forbringing a prosecu-
tion.

3. priscis verbis: language bor-
rowed from the usages of the repub-
lic. The phrase quoted by Tiberius
had reference to the proclamation
of martial law, not to ordinary crim·
inal prosecutions.

quasi, etc.: as if there were any
reality in the forms of the republic.

4. cuius ira: i.e. that it was on
the ground of his friendship for

Agrippina.
conscientia . . . foedata: Intr.
3511qiior Sosia: i.e. her offences.
arguebantur, were charged
against kim,

5. haerebant, were caught.

maiestatis: the correct ground,
if he was guilty of complicity in the
rebellion of Sacrovir ; and Tacitus
does not deny that he was. Stahr.

20. tamen: this was in violation
of the rule mentioned VI. 29. 2,—
that, of those who escaped condem-
nation by suicide, manebant testa-
menta.

stipendiariis, tlte tributaries of
the province, in behalf of whom
the charge of repetundae had been
prosecuted ; but it seems they them-
selves took no part in the prosecu-
tion (nemo repetebat).

liberalitas Augusti: the gifts
bestowed upon him by Augustus.

singillatim: a strict reckoning
by items.

2. ea prima, etc.: see III. 18. 2,
‚satisfirmus adversum pecuniam.
