omission of the interrogative par-
ticle is not in itself uncommon,

course.

16. Idistaviso: the last part of
this word is evidently the German
Wiese (meadow); the first part is

and Tiberius had penetrated to the
Elbe. For patrui, see Ι.. 33. 3 n.
isdem in terris: z‘.e. the region
beyond the Weser.
15. 2. fugacissimos: i.e. they
had escaped from the slaughter of
Varus, and had mutinied for fear of

 

being exposed again to a like
danger3 cf. ceterorum Britannorum
fugacissimi, Agr. 34.

seditionem: referring to the
