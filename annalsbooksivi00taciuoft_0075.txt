ANNALS.

moderante Tiberio ne plures quam quattuor candidatos
commendaret, sine repulsa et ambitu designandos

Inter quae tribuni plebei petivere ut proprio sumptu 3
ederent ludos, qui de nomine Augusti fastis 'additi

Augustaies vocarentur.

Sed decreta pecunia ex aera· 4

ri0‚ utque per circum triumphali veste uterentur ; curru

torem translata cui inter cives et peregrinos iurisdictio

evenisset.

Hic rerum urbanarum status erat, cum Pannonicas 16

legiones seditio incessit, nullis novis causiS, nisi quod

senators, who had heretofore been

obliged to canvass for votes (largi-

tionibus ac precibus sordidis).
tenuit: sc. ius.

plures . . . candidatos: sc.

. , praeturae. These were called can-

didati Caesaris. The commendatio
sine repulsa et ambitu was equiva-
lent to an appointment, and grew
out of the formal and official suffra-
gatio, or personal canvassing of the
republic. Augustus had continued
the republican form of suffragatio .·

’ tribus cum candidatis suis circumi-

bat, supplicabatque more sollemni
(Suet. Oct. 56). Velleius (ΙΙ. 124)
relates an interesting fact, in relation

ξ ’ to this commendation: mihi fra-

trique meo, candidatis Caesaris . . .
destinari praetoribus contigit, con·
secutis, ut neque post nos quemquam
divus Augustus, neque ante nos Cae-
sar commendaret Tiberius.

3. Augustales: these games had
been celebrated from time to time
Oct. 12 by order of the senate, but
were now made annual and extended
so as to last from Oct. 3 to 12, thus
coming between the Great or Roman
Games in September, and the Plebe-
ian Games in November. The cult
of Augustus in the city was distinet
from, although closely connected

with, that in the provinces, men-
tioned 10. 5. As is stated in the
note on that passage, Augustus re-
fused to have it established in the
city during his lifetime. It now be-
came one of the principal forms of
worship, and a powerful instrument
in the maintenance of the imperial
authority (Intr. 24).

vocarentur: subjunctive, as being
part of their request.

4. decreta pecunia: to carry on
the games at their own expense
would have gained them too much
popularity. Notice the ut clause
depending upon decretum, implied
in decreta.

triumphali veste t the toga picta,
embroidered with gold, and the
tunica palmata, embroidered with
palm leaves in gold.

curru vehi: this honor belonged
to the ptaetors, to whom the trib-
unes were inferior in dignity.

praetorem cui, etc.: commonly
known as praetor peregy·z'nus, a
term which is not found in classic
authors.

evenisset: the pluperfect tense
here represents the future perfect
indicative of the direct discourse.

16. Pannonicas: Pannonia, or
Illyricum superius, conquered by
