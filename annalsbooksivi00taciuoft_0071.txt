great grief to Tiberius. Suetonius

“ (Tib. 7) calls her Agrippina, and

relates this incident: semel omnino
ex occursu visam adeo contentis et
umentibus oculis prosecutus est, ut
custoditum sit ne umquam in con-
spectum eius posthac veniret.

civilia: this marriage, like the
proposition of Sejanus to marry
Livia (IV. 39) betrayed an ambition
beyond a private station.

guished orator and *man of letters.

3. Cn. Pisonem: a man ingenio
violentum et obsequii ignarum (II.
43). His grandfather was legatus
of Pompey in his eastern wars. He

the cause of his own death (III.
