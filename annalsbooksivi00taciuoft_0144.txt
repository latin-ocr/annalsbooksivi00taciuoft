3. obtegens, obscuring. His
contempt for such superstitions is
mentioned also by Dio Cassius
(LVII. 14), who says that, while
others took these events as an omen,
he ascribed them to the excess of
water, and appointed a standing
board of five senators, selected by
lot, to have charge of the river, and
to regulate the supply of water. A
recently discovered inscription of the
reign of Claudius gives the names of
five curatores aquarum et alvei Τ i-
beris ex auctoritate Ti. Claudi Cae-
saris Aug. Germanici Principis.
Antiquary, February, 1888.

Ateio Capitoni: for his death
and character, see ΙΙΙ. 75. He was
curator aquarum, an office which
he held for ten years, A.D. 13 to 23,
succeeding Messala. Augustus had
established, among other offices, the
curam . . . aquarum, alvei Tiberis,
etc. (Suet. Oct. 37).

4. Achaiam: this province, em-
bracing Greece proper, was sepa-
rated from Macedonia by Augustus,
B.C. 27, and received its name from
its leading state, the Achaean league.
In the division of the empire be-
tween the senate and the emperor,
Achaia and Macedonia, like most
of the older provinces requiring no

military force, were left under the
senatorial administration of the re·
public, and governed by proconsuls,
proconsulari imperio. The ad-
ministration of these officers was
more oppressive than that of the
legati who governed the imperial

provinces. They were chosen by . ’

lot, held office for only a year, and
surrounded themselves with a degree
of pomp which the military legati

did not affect. Moreover, they were ⁷

paid by the province, while the

legati were paid by the emperor ’ < 

whom they represented. It was
therefore a favor to these provinces
levari proconsulari imperio tra-
dique Caesari. They were annexed
to the province of Moesia (see 80.
1), but were again made senatorial
provinces by Claudius. Nipperdey
suggests that, as imperial provinces,
they were relieved from the tribute
which they owed to the aerarium.

5. quamquam qualifies vili, tak-
ingpleasure overmuclc in blood, even
clzeap blood —- he was too lavish even
of the lives of the vulgar. See 29. 4,
promptum ad asperiora ingenium
Druso erat.

formidolosum, calculated to in-
spire fear.

et = etiam.

6. ipse: Tiberius.

trahebant, interpreted, Cf. 62. 3.
