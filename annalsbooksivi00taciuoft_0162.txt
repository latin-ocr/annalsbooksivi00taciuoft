* 116 TACITUS. [BOOK 11.

integrum equitem equosque per ora et alveos fluminum
6 media in Germania fore. Igitur huc intendit, missis
ad census Galliarum P. Vitellio et C. Antio. Silius et
Anteius et Caecina fabricandae classi praeponuntur.
2 Mille naves sufficere visae properataeque: aliae breveS,
angusta puppi proraque et lato uter0, quo facilius fluctus
tolerarent, quaedam planae carinis, ut sine noxa side-
rent ; plures appositis utrimque gubernaculiS‚ converso

pontibus stratae, super quas tormenta veherentur, simul
aptae ferendis equis aut commeatui; velis habileS, citae .’
remis augebantur alacritate militum in speciem ac terro—

integrum: sc. viribus. They had
been worn out by the long marches
of the previous year.

6. huc: to this plan,—an ad-
vance by water.

ad census: see note on agendo
censui, Ι. 31. 2.

P. Vitellio: see Ι. 70. The name
of Antius occurs upon an inscrip-
tion. For Silius and Caecina see 1. 31 .

Anteius: not otherwise known;
as it is Tacitus’ habit to give the
praenomen on the first mention of a
person, and as it is unlikely that an
obscure person would be joined with
the two governors, Nipperdey reads
here Apronius (Ι. 56. 1).

2. mille naves: for conveying
the entire army and stores. These
ships were of three classes,—the
first for the sea; the largest number
(plures) for river navigation3 also
a large number (multae) for the
conveyance of horses and engines.
It is probable, as Knoke suggests
(p. 296), that the first class con·
veyed the troops to the mouth of
the Ems, where they were trans-
ferred to smaller boats.

breves ε i.e. contrasted with
naves longae, ships-of·war. This
class was designed for conveying

the troops through the sea ; the two
other classes, for river navigatiom

Knoke.
utero = alveo.

quaedam: i.e, a part of those , ,

already described.

planae earinis, etc.: so in Caesar,
B. G. ΙΙΙ. 13, of the Gallie ships:
carinae aliquanto planiores quam
nostrarum navium, quo facilius
vada ac decessum aestus excipere
possent. Dutch vessels are still built
with broad, flat keels, so as to rest
easily on the sand.

siderent: in the shallows along
the coast and the ebb-tide; Knoke,
less probably, refers it to river shal-
lows.

lows (Germ. 44): utrimque prora

paratam semper appulsui frontem
agit. The viking' ships discovered
of late years have this shape.

converso, etc.: cf. Hist. ΙΙΙ. 47,
pari utrimque prora et mutabili
remigio,

3. pontibus, decks.

citae: here a participle, im-
pelled,· referring (as well as habiles)
to all the ships.

augebantur: i.e. when the sol-
