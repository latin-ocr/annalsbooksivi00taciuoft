Empire‚ I. p. 26.) When they went
into winter quarters (30. 3), it was
within the walls of the town.

tres legiones: the VHI. (Augus-
ta), IX. (Hispana), and XV. (Apol-

Tiberius (12—9 B.C.),and organized
as a province a few years later,
comprised at this time the country
upon the rivers Drave and Save. It
was afterwards extended north to the

great bend of the Danube below
Vienna, and was always one of the
most important provinces from a
military point of view. Between the
three legions posted here and 'the
eight legions upon the Rhine (that
is, in the provinces of Raetia and
Noricum), there were no troops ex-
cept a few scattered garrisons of
auxiliaries. The mutiny in Panno-
nia, therefore, followed by that of
the German legions, threatened to
strip the entire northern frontier of
its defences.
