PRovINCEs OF THE EMPIRE. xxi

ernors sent from Rome with absolute authority over all provin-
cials, it is to be understood, however, that within the borders
of nearly every province there were not only communities of
Roman citizens, but also cities and principalities which had re-
tained their nominal independence as allies of the Roman peo-
ple, and that neither of these classes was in law subJect to the
governor. During the reign of Tiberius the number of provinces
was increased to thirty by the annexation of Cappadocia, and

the division of Germany into Upper and Lower. Of the twenty· .

eight provinces, eleven were governed, after the method of the
Republic, by proconsuls commissioned by the senate 3 one,
Egypt, was in strictness of speech not a province at all, but a
kingdom, of which the emperor was king 3 the other sixteen
were placed under the immediate government of the emperor,
who administered them by deputies‚ legati, clothed with com-
plete 'govemmental authority, as his representatives, or by fiscal

. agents, procuratores.'
