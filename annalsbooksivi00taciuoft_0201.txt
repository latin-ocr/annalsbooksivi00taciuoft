deminutionem tributi orabant. Igitur haec et de Ar- 43
menia quae supra memoravi apud patres disseruit, nec
posse motum Orientem nisi Germanici sapientia com-
poni ; nam suam aetatem vergere, Drusi nondum satis
adolevisse. Tunc decreto patrum permissae Germanico 2 ,
provinciae quae mari dividuntur, maiusque imperium,
quoquo adisset, quam iis qui sorte aut missu principis
obtinerent. Sed Tiberius demoverat Suria Creticum 3
Silanum, per adfinitatem conexum Germanico (quia Si-
lani filia Neroni vetustissimo liberorum eius pacta erat),
praefeceratque Cn. Pisonem, ingenio violentum et obse-

 

part of the province of Syria, but
had a separate financial administra-
tion, under a procurator. It became

's . an independent province after its

subjection by Titus, A.D. 70.

43. supra: see chaps. 3 and 4.

nec: connects haec, etc„ with
the clause posse . . . componi.

motum: used adjectively.

vergere: not used in relation to
time by earlier writers. Tiberius
was now fifty-nine, Drusus about
thirty.

2. provinciae quae mari divi-
duntur: i.e. all the provinces of
Asia, — Syria, Cilicia, Cyprus, Bithy-
nia, Galatia, Pamphylia, and Asia.
The republics of Rhodes and Lycia,
the kingdom of Cappadocia for a
short time, and that part of Pontus
which lay north of Cappadocia, were
still independent, but were shortly
incorporated in the empire. Egypt
was not included in his command,
for the reason that Egypt was never
reckoned as a province, but as a

1 kingdom3 see 593 4 n.

maius imperium: so that the
governors of the provinces were
placed under‘his authority. Momm.
Rb'm. St. Ι. 57.

sorte aut missu principis: i.e.
imperial or senatorial governors

(Intr. 17). The governors of the
senatorial provinces were assigned
by lot ; those of the imperial prov·
inces were appointed by the em-
peror.

3. Creticum Silanum: see 4. 4.

Cn. Pisonem: the family of the
Pisos was among the oldest and
most powerful of the noble fami-
lies of Rome, and Gnaeus was at
this time perhaps its leading mem-
ber. He was a man of large expe-
rience, ambitious, and sels-asserting
(see Ι. 13. 3), and of aviolent temper.
Seneca (de Ira, I. 18. 3), relating a
gross instance of cruelty and injus-
tice perpetrated by him as governor
of Spain, calls him vir a multis
vitiis integer, sed pravus et cuz·
placebat pro constantia rzgror. That
he was appointed by Tiberius with
the commission to murder Germani-
cus, as Tacitus insinuates, there is
absolutely no evidence ; if the em·-
peror wished to be rid of his adopted
son, he needed not to resort to this
clumsy method of attaining his end.
That Piso committed the murder
for his own end has as little evi-
dence, and is in the highest degree
improbable ; if he had intended to
do this, he would not have begun
by insubordination and insult, but
