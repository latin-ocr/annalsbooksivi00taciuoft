2. summi fastigii vocabulum:
Mommsen, in his R'o‘mz'sclzes Staals-
recht, shows that the tribunician
power, even though lacking the
imperium, or full power of com-
mand, was the highest in the state,
being sacrosanct, or protected by an
inviolable sanctity, and having the
power to control the actions of all
other magistrates (cetera impe-
ria praemineret; cf. Ι. 2. 1 n.).
It was from the assumption of the
tribunician power that the emperors
dated their reigns. The association
of Agrippa and Tiberius in this office
was equivalent to nominating them
as successors, and that was the mean-
ing of the present association of
Drusus (ne successor in incerto
foret). On the first grant of this
power to Tiberius, however (B.C.
7), Gaius and Lucius were still alive
and designated as successors; the
second grant (A.D. 4) was equiva-

lent to appointing Tiberius as suc-
cessor.

ne . . . assumeret: see 1. 2. 1.

cetera imperia (Intr. 35 b): prop-
erly the tribunician power was not
an imperium at all.

4. simul . . . fidebat: by the aet
in question Tiberius received equal
rights in law with Augustus, and
was only restrained by modestia and
pietas from claiming equality in
power and station.

5. integrum . . . iudicium, an
impartial judgment, as to which
should be his successor.

6. consilia: object of prospe·
tarent.

in falsum aucta, exaggerated.

7. tres liberos: two sons (II.
84. 1), and a daughter Julia (29. 43
VI. 27. 1).

eam aetatem: thirty-five. Tibe·
rius was born ΒΕ. 42, and first re·
ceived the tribunician power, B.C. 7.
