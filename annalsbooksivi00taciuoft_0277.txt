ANNALS.

aliave urbis templa perfugere ut eo subsidio ad flagitia
utatur; abolitas leges et funditus versaS, ubi in foro, 3
in limine curiae ab Annia Rufilla, quam fraudis sub
iudice damnavisset, probra sibi et minae intendantur,
neque ipse audeat ius experiri ob effigiem imperatoris
oppositam. Haud dissimilia alii et quidam atrociora 4
circumstrepebant, precabanturque Drusum daret ultionis
exemplum, donec accitam convictamque attineri publica

custodia iussit.

about her conviction3 the words sub

the officers and the courts, a repre-
sentative of the emperor was called
upon to correct it.

accitam, etc.: sc. Anniam.

37. 2. utrumque, both acts,· the
punishment of Annia and that of
these two men.

secreta, tlte sullen tyranny.

3. luxus: Drusus is represented
(Ι. 29. 4 and 76. 5) as cruel in dispo-
sition, but no charge has been made
of licentiousness. His luxury seems
to have consisted partly in erect-
ing magnificent buildings (aedifica-
tionibus).

solus, etc.: these words point to
the alleged characteristics of his
father's rule; and yet nothing has
so far appeared to throw upon him
the burden of the charges. He was
undoubtedly severe by nature, and
disposed to let the laws have their
course. In the case of Antistius in
the next chapter, the punishment
ap ears to have been merited.

8. et: introduces an illustration
of the general statement; cf. II. 50. 1.
