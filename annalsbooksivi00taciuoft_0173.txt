17. per ferociam, impatiently‚
thus disturbing the plan of the
battle (Intr. 35 i).

validissimos, Stertinium: both
with their infinitives depending on
iubet. The former were to attack
the Cheruscans on the right flank
as they descended from the ridge,
while Stertinius made a circuit on
the mountain side, and took the
German position in the rear.

adfuturus: i.e. to attack in front,
co-operating in season with these
flank movements,

2. octo aquilae: this was the
number of legions in the army, and
the standard of the legion was a
silver eagle (propria legionum
numina).

silvas: where the enemy were.

advertere, attracted the attention
of: cf. Ι. 41. 13 gemitusque ac planc-
tus etiam militum aures oraque
advertere.

3. praemissus eques: that is,
both the validissimi equitum, and
those under Stertinius.

postremos: the entire rear, in-

cluding the Cherusci, who were fur· ’

thest from the river. These were
attacked by Stertinius.

4. duo . . . agmina: those who
occupied the woods were pushed for-
ward into the plain, because the hills
in their rear were occupied by the
cavalry forces 3 those in the plain,
attacked in front by the pedestris
acies, fell back into the woods.
The imperfect shows the effort at
these movements, but all was in
confusion.

5. medii inter hos: so as to add
to the confusion.

detrudebantur: by Stertinius.

vulnere: by braving wounds,
thus inspiring by his example.
These ablatives qualify sustenta-
bat.

6. illa rupturus, and would lzave
burst through at tlzat point.

vindelicorum: the Vindelici,
occupying the southwestern part
of Bavaria (Augsburg is Augusta
Vindelicorum) formed a part of
