via, sister of Octavianus, but after-
wards deserted her for Cleopatra,
queen of Egypt. The marriage was
arranged in the treaty of Brundi-
sium, ΒΕ. 40, which by reason of

. this association is mentioned after
³> that of Tarentum, which took place

ἰ in 37.

3. clades: both of these were

' in Germany: the defeat of Lollius,

B.c. 16; that of Varus with great
loss (the famous battle of the Teu-
toburg forest, against Arminius, 60.

cate that these are only instances.
Varro and Egnatius were put to

⁷ death for conspiracy, B.C. 23 (or 22)

and 19 respectively3 Iulus (a son

γ of Mark Antony), for adultery with

Julia, was obliged to put himself to

1 death, 13.c. 2.

4. abducta . . . uxor: Livia,

ss mother (by Nero) of Tiberius andv

Drusus, and, as Tacitus represents,

gravis mater to the state, upon
’ which she imposed her son Tiberius

as ruler; and gravis noverca to
the house of Caesar, being suspected

‘⁷ of causing the death of the young

princes Gaius and Lucius.
Vedii Pollionis: see App. Ι.
This Vedius Pollio, a friend of Au-

gustus, used to throw his condemned
slaves to the lampreys in his fish-
pond. His immense house was torn
down by his heir, Augustus, and
the Livian portico constructed in
its place, quia luxuria visa nocere
sua, Ovid‚ Fast. VI. 644. See Sen-
eca, de Ira. ΙΙΙ. 40.

5. se coli : the craving of Augus-
tus for divine honors, ascribed to
him here, appears to be shown also
by inscriptions. ‘⁴ According to all
appearance, the worship of the liv·
ing ruler‚ making its appearance
simultaneously throughout Italy,
was, if not directly instigated by
him, at least expressly authorized.”
(Mommsen, Hermes, XVII. p. 641.

andria’ by Prof. A. C. Merriam,
Trans. of Am. Phil. Ass„ 1883.)
Tiberius constantly refused it
(Intr. 24). Augustus, too, in the
city, according to Suetonius (Oct.
52), declined it: nam in urbe qui·
dem pertinacissime abstinuit hoc
honore: and in the provinces in-
sisted upon being associated with
the goddess Roma, communi suo
Romaeque nomine. This cult be-
came the leading religion of the
provinces, as is abundantly shown
by inscription53 being in each city
in the hands of a college of priests
called Augustales (Intr. 24).
