Nothing is known of the limes here
mentioned, except from this pas-

nate Roman and auxiliary troops
respectively; alas also relates to
auxiliary troops, all the cavalry
being furnished by the auxiliaries.
An ala contained either 480 or 960
men.

quarum: relates to both co-
hortes and alas. See note on
auxilia, 36. 2. For the geography
of the expedition see Excursus, at
end of this book.

50· agitabant z erant or dege-
bant .· a meaning frequent in Sallust
and Tacitus.

2. Romanus: used collectively.

silvam Caesiam: this name ap-
pears to be preserved in that of the
modern Heisingen, nearly east of
Xanten‚ and south of the Lippe.

limitem: this term originally
designated the mad-way, of varying
breadth, separating the squares of
land laid out according to the rules
of the Roman Agrimensores. It

⁷ thus came to mean any artificial

vroad-way, and especially any arti-
ficially constructed boundary, as
contrasted with natural boundaries
(rivers, mountain-ranges, etc.). It
was not a line, but a belt of some
width (castra in limite locat) de-
fended by earthworks (ΙΙ. 7), ditches,
masonry, and redoubts, and could
only be crossed at certain points,
answering to bridges over a river

(Mommsen, Provinces, Ι. 132).

have been laid out by Tiberius
when he took command of the
troops in this region after the de-
feat of Varus, as a defence against
the insurgent Germans (see Meri-

vale, Hist„ IV. 278). This policy

was afterwards carried out along

the greater part of the German - ’

frontier, especially that long stretch,
unprotected by rivers, from the
neighborhood of Mentz on the

Rhine to Ratisbon on the Danube ; ⁷ ιγ ἶ

the limes here was constructed prin-

cipally by Domitian. The walls of ·

Hadrian and Antonine in Britain
are examples of the same policy.
The limes in this passage would
appear to have been about a day's
march from the Roman camp at
Vetera. So far was Roman terri-
tory3 beyond this the Romans were
in the enemy's country, and their
course was doubtful.

coeptum, laid out.

scindit, penetrates; there is a
kind of zeugma here, — they pene-
trated the forest, and reached the
limes, upon which they entered, thus
‘ cutting' it in two, and encamped,
using its walls for two sides of their
camp.

frontem, etc.: Greek accusatives,
common in poetry, but not found in
prose writers of the classical period.

concaedibus, abattis,· to protect
