tulit, illae oblivione, hae, quod flagitiosius est, con·
temptu abolitae securiorem luxum fecere. Nam si velis 4
quod nondum vetitum est, timeas ne vetere 3 at si pro-
hibita impune transcenderiS, neque metusultra neque
pudor est. Cur ergo olim parsimonia pollebat? Quia 5
sibi quisque moderabatur, quia unius urbis cives era—
mus ; ne irritamenta quidem eadem intra Italiam domi-
nantibus, Externis victoriis aliena, civilibus etiam
nostra consumere didicimus. Quantulum istud est, de 6
quo aediles admonent! Quam, si cetera respiciaS, in
levi habendum! At hercule nemo refert, quod Italia
externae opis indiget, quod vita populi Romani per in-
certa maris et tempestatum cotidie volvitur. Ac nisi 7
provinciarum copiae et dominis et servitiis et agris sub-
venerint, nostra nos scilicet nemora nostraeque villae
tuebuntur! HanC, patres conscripti, curam sustinet 8
princeps; haec omissa funditus rem publicam trahet.
Reliquis intra animum medendum est: nos pudor, pau· 9

 

4. nam si velis, etc.: the sup-
position is that the thing desired is
wrong, and liable to be forbidden
by laW, although this has not yet
been done. Such moral delinquen·
cies are less dangerous than open
and unpunished violations of law.

5. unius urbis: down to the
time of the Punic Wars Rome was
still a city, not yet an empire‚ and
its dominion was confined to Italy.

irritamenta, incitements to lux-
ury. He points to the fatal effects
of foreign conquest, in undermining
national character ; after the great
foreign wars of the second century
B.C. the tributum or land tax was
no longer ‘imposed upon citizens
(aliena consumere didicimus).

6. quantulum, etc.: the passage
which follows contains a truth of
profound importance. The real

cause of decay was not to be found
in the petty details of luxury cen-
sured by the aediles, but in the con-
version of all Italy into pleasure-
grounds and pastures (nemora vil-
laeque), so that its inhabitants
must be supported by tribute levied
on all the rest of the world.

per incerta, etc.: relates to the
perils of the sea, made necessary by
this dependence of Italy upon for·
eign countries (quod Italia exter-
nae opis indiget).

8. hane euram ε the manage-
ment of the annona, or supply of
corn, one of the most important func-
tions of the government at this time.

9. reliquis (neuter) ε another
important truth—the disease was
internal, not to be healed by super-

ficial remedies.
