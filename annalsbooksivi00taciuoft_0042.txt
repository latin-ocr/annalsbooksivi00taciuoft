xxxviii INT‘RODUCTION.

even in subordinate temporal clauses; eg. Ubi Artabanus
minitari, when Artabanus threatened, II. 4. 4.

He is very fond of stringing a number of historical infinitives,
one after another, in the way of enumeration3 e.g. lascivire
miles, discordare, pessimi cuiusque sermonibus praebere aures, etc.‚
the soldiers fell into lawlessness and disorder, lent their ears to
the talk ofevery mischieff—maker, etc„ Ι. 16. 3.

l. The complementary infinitive is common after verbs and
adjectives where earlier prose writers would have used a subor—
dinate clause or a gerund3 e.g. perfringere nisi, attemptz‘ng to
burst through, Ι. 64. 1 ; dato sacerdotibus . . . vera discernere,
the priests being authorized to ch‘stinguish the genuine, VI.
12. 4.

m. In clauses of comparison he commonly omits the correla-

creetly he had boiled over with rage, the more patient when his
anger was over, Ι. 74. 7.

use of the genitive, e.g. cognoscendae antiquitatis, for the pur-

mandae concordiae, sor the purpose of protecting liberty and
establishing harmony, III. 27. 1.

0. There is great freedom also in the use of the participle,
especially in the ablative neuter, used absolutely with a word
understood, or with a·clause or phrase3 e.g. concedente, sc. ec,
with his permission, VI. 16. 5 3 addito acutiorem esse, adding
that it was sharper, Ι. 35. 6.

Another common construction is the omission, in ablative
absolute, of the subject when it is antecedent to a relative3
e.g. provisis quae tempus monebat, having made provision os such
things as the exigency demanded, I. 5. 6.
