318 TACITUS. ι [BOOK lv.

ex eo suspicio Agrippinae, et intacta ore servis tramisit.
Nec tamen Tiberii ,vox coram secuta, sed, obversus ad
matrem, non mirum ait si quid severius in eam statuis-
4 set, a qua veneficii insimularetur. Inde rumor parari
exitium, neque id imperatorem palam audere, secretum
ad perpetrandum quaeri.
55 Sed Caesar quo famam averteret, adesse frequens
senatui legatosque Asiae, ambigentes quanam in civitate
2 templum statueretur, pluris per dies audivit. Undecim
urbes certabant, pari ambitione, viribus diversae. Neque
multum distantia inter se memorabant de vetustate ge-
neris, studio in populum Romanurn per bella Persi et
3 Aristonici aliorumque regum. Verum Hypaepeni Tral-
lianique Laodicenis ac Magnetibus simul tramissi ut
4 parurn validi3 ne Ilienses quidem, cum parentem urbis

Romae Troiam referrent, nisi antiquitatis gloria polle· ,

5 bant. Paulum addubitatum, quod Halicarnasii mille et
ducentos per annos nullo motu terrae nutavisse sedes

3. coram, addressed to ker.

statuisset, should determine, rep-
resenting the future perfect of direct
address.

4. secretum, a secret opportunity.

55. famam: of his designs
against Agrippina.

templum. see 15. 4.

audivit: joined by a peculiar
combination with the historical in·
finitive adesse.

2. Persi: this form of this gen-
itive (as if from Perses) is found
also in Sallust. Perseus, king of
Macedonia, was subdued by the
Romans in the battle of Pydna,

13.c. 168.

'' Aristonici: Aristonicus, natural
son of Eumenes ΙΙ., king of Per—
gamuS, revolted after the death of
Attalus 111„ and attempted to set
aside the provisions of his will,

which bequeathed his dominions to
the Roman people. He was cap-
tured and sent to Rome, where he
was beheaded, B.C. 129.

3. Hypaepeni, etc.: Hypaepa
was a town on the southern slope
of Mt. Tmolus ; Tralles, Laodicea,
and Magnesia had all been consid·
erable towns, but had suffered from
earthquakes (Strabo, XII. 579) ; the
Magnesia mentioned by Strabo is
the one ὑπὸ Σιπύλῳ, from which it
is probable that that is the one here
referred to.

simul: used here as a preposi··
tion, governing the ablative (Intr.
35 i); cf. III. 64. 3.

tramissi, passed over.

4. Ilienses: see ΙΙ. 54. 3 n.

5. Halicarnasii: Halicarnassus,
in Caria, was the most important of
the Dorian cities of Asia Minor.
