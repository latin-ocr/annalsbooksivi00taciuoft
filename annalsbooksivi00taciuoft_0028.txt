xxiv INTRODUCFI‘ON.

m'bunz’cz‘a potestas, which was conferred upon him for life, and
gave him the powers of the tribunate without the limitations to
which this magistracy was subject. The tribunician power,
making his person sacred, giving him an unlimited right to
prohibit the actions of other magistrates, and making him in a
peculiar sense the representative of the people‚ was the con-
summation of his authority, being always bestowed after the
proconsular power. As pontifex maximus too he possessed
the entire control of the organized religion of the state, and
the essential powers of the censorship were placed in his
hands under the title regimen morum. The title which de-
scribed the emperor as the possessor of this bundle of powers,
military and civil, was princeps,¹ prince, and this is the term .
usually employed by Tacitus. Ι

21. All the powers thus gathered in the hands of the prince
were recognized powers of Roman magistrates. The Empire
as a system of government did not, in its first years, contain a

· single principle which had not already existed under the Repub-

lic. What was novel was the combining of all these powers in
the hands of one man as a permanent possession. The prince
was a magistrate, created by law, and amenable to law3 the
new magistracy fitted perfectly into the republican scheme.
But it was an assemblage of powers so extraordinary and
controlling that its possessor was in practice raised far above
every other person or body of persons in the state. (See the
interesting letter of Tiberius, III. 53.) It may be compared to
the dictatorship of the early Republic, which consisted in the
bestowal of extraordinary power upon one man, to meet an
extraordinary crisis. The crisis had now become chronic, and
the dictatorship was made permanent. (See Seeley’s first lecture
on Roman Imperialism.)

¹ This title of prinee is usually associated with the republican dignity
of princeps senatus. According to Mommsen, however (Rb'misclzes Staats-
recht, ΙΙ. 734), he was rather chief of the citizens, der gewiclztzgrste und
angesehenste Bic’rger: the title princeps senatus was never given to the
emperor until the time of Pertinax (id.‚ 111. 971).
