idonea manu, vinctum clauso ore in Palatium traxere.
5 Percontanti Tiberio quo modo Agrippa factus esset,

respondisse fertur ‘Quo modo tu Caesar.’

6 socios subigi non potuit.

Ut ederet
Nec Tiberius poenam eius

palam ausuS, in secreta Palatii parte interfici iussit cor-

pusque clam auferri.

Et quamquam multi e domo prin-

cipis equitesque ac senatores sustentasse opibuS‚ iuvisse
consiliis dicerentur, haud quaesitum.

Fine anni arcus propter aedem Saturni ob recepta signa
cum Varo amissa ductu Germanici, auspiciis Tiberii, et
aedes Fortis Fortunae Tiberim iuxta in hortis quos Caesar
dictator populo Romano legaverat, sacrarium genti Iuliae
effigiesque divo Augusto apud Bovillas dicantur. ’

C. Caelio L. Pomponio consulibus Germanicus Caesar

a. d. vn. Kal. Iunias triumphavit de Cheruscis Cha-t-

5. quomodo tu Caesar: per-
sisting in his claim, or perhaps inso-
lently reminding Tiberius that he
was no real Caesar. Furneaux takes
it as imputing fraud to Tiberius;
but his succession was public and
regular.

6. haud quaesitum: a wise and
mild policy. The rumor, however,
of accomplices within the palace,
following the discovery of Libo's
conspiracy, must have been one of
the predisposing causes of Tiberius'
jealous and suspicious disposition in
his later years.

41. arcus: this arch stood over
the Sacred Way, at the point where
it met the Vicus begarius, at the
corner of the Basilica Julia‚ just
below the Temple of Saturn.

aedem Saturni: the temple, at
the foot of the Clivus Capitolinus,
used as the treasury (aerarium).
There still stand eight columns be·
longing to it, or rather to a restora-
tion of it in the fourth century.

ob recepta signa: see I. 60. 4
and ΙΙ. 25. 2.

ductu Germanici, auspiciis
Tiberii: cf. 18. 2 n; even a vic-
tory gained by a colleague or crown
prinee, as Germanicus was, was
referred to the auspices of the em-
peror, as in the case of an ordi-
nary legatus. Momm. Ram. St. 11.
10 4. γ
{ortis Fortunae: the goddess
of Chance; her temple, on the
other side of the Tiber, was the
scene of a popular festival, June 24,
frequented especially by slaves and
unfortunate people; the river was
thronged with gayly-adorned boats.
Ov. Fast. VI. 777.

in hortis, etc.: cf. Horace, Sat.
1. 9. 18: trans Tiberim . . . prope
Caesaris hortos. The plural horti
denotes plemam-grounds, park.

Bovillas: see Ι. 54. 1 n.

2. triumphavit: this was voted
two years before (Ι. 55. 13 see also
Ι. 72. 1 n.).
