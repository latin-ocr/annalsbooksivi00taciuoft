a Q. Haterio consulari, Octavio Frontone praetura
functo ; decretumque ne vasa auro solida ministran-

dis cibis fierent, ne vestis serica viros foedaret.

cessit Fronto ac postulavit modum argento supellectili

familiae.

quid e re publica crederent, loco sententiae promere]
Contra <Gallus Asinius disseruit: auctu imperii adole-
visse etiam privatas opeS, idque non novum, sed e vetus-
tissimis moribus ; aliam apud Fabricios, aliam apud

portam Esquilinam: within the
modern Porta Maggiore, the regular
place for such executions.

cum classicum . . . iussissent:

,. , on the morning of the day of trial,

the trumpet was sounded on the
citadel, arx, around the walls, and
finally before the house of the
accused.

more prisco advertere: the
punishment more prisco, of one
who was judged a public enemy,
was to be put naked in the pillory
and flogged to death: cum compe-
risset nudi hominis cervicem inseri
fhrcae, corpus virgis ad necem caedi
(Suet. Nero, 49). Usually, however,
he was scourged for a while and
then beheaded.

33. Q. Haterio: see Ι. 13. 4.

praetura functo: not merely of
praetorian rank (praetorius), but
having actually held the office 3 for
many by special grant enjoyed the
rank (ornamenta) without having
held the office.

foedaret: the Romans in early
times dressed wholly in wool, and
silk (serica) was 'regarded as at
once effeminate and indecent.

2. excessit: i.e. went further in

his propositions3 cf, 24. Ι.

C. Caecilius
Claudius Isidorus left at his death,
B.C. 8, 4116 slaves (Plin. H. JV.
XXXIII. 135).

erat quippe, etc.: when called
upon by the consul to give their
vote, dicere sententiam, upon any
proposition, they would add to it si
quid e re publica crederent ,· just as
Cato the Censor ended every speech
with the words censeo Karthaginem
esse delendam. This passage really

familiae, slaves.

has no bearing on the subject, inas· ,

much as Fronto's proposition was a
legitimate amendment; it is there-
fore placed by Nipperdey in brack-
ets, as a gloss.

frequens, a common practice.

3. id: z'.e. adolevisse . . . opes.

apud Fabricios: in the early
part of the third century B.C.

apud Scipiones ε during the
second century B.C. In the mean
time there had been a great in·
crease of wealth and luxury. In
the time of Fabricius it was for-
bidden to have of silver plate more
than one dish and a saltcellar, and
he, as censor, removed from the
senate the consular and ex·dictator
Publius Cornelius Rufinus, for having
ten pounds of plate (Livy, Epit. 14).
