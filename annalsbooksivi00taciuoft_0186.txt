tat Caesar ita moderanS‚ ne lenire neve asperare crimina
30 videretur. Accesserant praeter Trionem et Catum ac-
cusatores Fonteius Agrippa et C. Vibius, certabantque
cui ius perorandi in reum daretur, donec Vibius, quia nec
ipsi inter se concederent et Libo sine patrono introisset,
singillatim¹ se crimina obiecturum professus, protulit li-
bellos vecordes adeo ut consultaverit Libo an habi-
turus foret opes, quis viam Appiam Brundisium usque
2 pecunia operiret. Inerant et alia huiusce modi stolida
vana, si mollius accipereS, miseranda. Uni tamen li-
bello manu Libonis nominibus Caesarum aut senatorum
additas atroces vel occultas notas accusator arguebat.
3 Negante reo agnoscentes servos per tormenta inter-
rogari placuit. Et quia vetere senatus consulto quaestio
in caput domini prohibebatur, callidus et novi iuris re-
pertor Tiberius mancipari singulos actori publico iubet,

moderans: sc. sibi or verbis.

pose rather than a result; —showing
suclz sels-restraint as not to seem.

30. certabant: when more than
one person wished to conduct the
prosecution, the decision between
them was made by the magistrate,
by a procedure known as divinatio,
as in the case of Cicero and Caecilius
in the impeachment of Verres.

perorandi, pleading in a set
speech.

singillatim: taking up the items
of the indictment one by one, as
Cicero had done against Verres.

consultaverit: sc. Chaldaeos,
etc.

viam Appiam: this road was
360 miles long; it was a puerile
charge, as Tacitus sayS, but it was
implied that it was only as emperor
that he could hope to possess such
means.

2. si mollius acciperes: quali-
fies miseranda.

notas: partly magic characters,
(occultas), partly of a criminal
nature (atroces).

3. agnoscentes: though they
testified voluntarily, their testimony
was not valid without torture.

quaestio in caput domini: see
Cic. pro Mil. 22. 59 ; pro Deiot. 1.

is hard to see, therefore, why Tibe·

subterfuge here mentioned.

novi iuris repertor: as a matter
of fact, this device had been em-

With some reason, therefore, Stahr

generally a slave or a freedman.
By the sale of the slaves to him
they became servi publici, and
