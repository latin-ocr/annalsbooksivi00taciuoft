49. coeptas ab Augusto‘: it
was the policy of Augustus to revive
early forms of Roman worship, which
had fallen into disuse‚ being obscured
by the more fashionable rites of
Greece and the Orient. This re·
vival of the national deities had a
certain value as a conservative force
in society, and especially in quick-
ening the sense of patriotism; but
as a religion, it was a mere piece of
antiquarianism, with no vitality.

Libero, etc.: this is the Eleusi-
nian triad, introduced very early in
the republic, as the first Greek rite
formally established in Rome. The
Roman deities identified with Deme-
ter, Dionysus, and Core hardly ap-
pear at all in the primitive religion
of Rome, and their worship is purely
Greek. The temple in question was

vowed by the dictator Aulus Postu- ·

mius, at the battle of Lake Regillus,
B.C. 496, and dedicated by Spurius
Cassius, three years later.

Lucio et Marco Publiciis: they
were brothers, and aediles, B.C. 240
or 238.

apud forum holitorium ε the
vegetable market was north of the

'Forum Boarium, or cattle market,

between the Capitoline and the
river, outside of the walls. Janus
was one of the most ancient gods
of Rome, originally a god of the
sun, but who had come to be re· “
garded as the god of beginnings.
The victory of Gaius Duilius here
mentioned, the first naval battle
gained by the Romans, was in the γ
first Punic War, B.C. 260.

2. Spei: the deification of ab·
straet qualities‚—Concordia, Pudi-
citia, Honor, etc.,—was very char-
acteristic of the Roman religion.

50. adolescebat: its begin-
nings have been described (Ι. 72-
74); it afterwards became the curse
of society in this reign. On this
occasion the emperor set himself
against the abuses of this law, and
mitigated the punishment of adul-
tery.

neptem: her mother was proba-
bly-one of the two daughters of
Octavia, by her first husband, Mar-
cellus. The other daughter married
Agrippa, and was mother of Hate-
rius Agrippa, mentioned in the next
chapter.
