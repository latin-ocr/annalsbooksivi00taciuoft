3. inter quae: this is general,
referring not to the judieial pro-
ceedings before the praetor, but to
the zeal shown by Tiberius in the
administration of justice.

mole, ductu: both probably de-

his agents. The investigation of the
case by the senate was open.

76. plana urbis: the low ground
between the Capitoline and the Pal-
atine. This was once a swamp, and
was drained by the cloaca maxi-
