TACITUS. [Boox I.

ubi decreto patrum fasces et ius ,praetoris invaserit,
caesis Hirtio et Pansa,—siVe hostis illos, seu Pansam
venenum vulneri adfusum, sui milites Hirtium et ma-
chinator doli Caesar abstulerat, —utriusque copias occu-
pavisse ; extortum invito senatu consulatum, armaque
quae in Antonium acceperit contra rem publicam versa3
proscriptionem civium, divisiones agrorum, ne ipsis
quidem qui secere laudatas, Sane Cassii et Brutorum

exitus paternis inimicitiis datos, quamquam fas sit pri- ¹

vata odia publicis utilitatibus remittere3 sed Pompeium
imagine paciS, sed Lepidum specie amicitiae deceptos ;
post Antonium, Tarentino Brundisinoque foedere et
nuptiis sororis illectum, subdolae adfinitatis poenas

ius praetoris: the praetorian
power, carrying with it the author·
ity to command troops, was be·
stowed upon him by the Senate3
Cic. Phil. v. 17. 46. It was strictly
an unconstitutional aet, Momm. Rom.
Staatsreclzt‚ ΙΙ. p. 621.

invaserit, entered upon, = got
possession os} containing the idea of
usurpation.

caesis: at the battle of Mutina,
March 13. The suspicion here
expressed (seu Pansam, etc.) is
alluded to by Suetonius (Oct. 11) z
Pansae quidem adeo suspecta mors
fuit ut Glyco medicus custoditus sit,
quasi venenum vulneri indidisset.

invito senatu: probably dative.
According to Suetonius (Oct. 26)
it was demanded nomine exercitus ‚·
his messenger, the centurion Corne-
lius, pointing to his sword, said, hic
faciet, si vos non feceritis·

proscriptionem: each of the
triumvirs made out a list of those
whom he wished put to death3 the
list was then posted, proscriptum,
and whoever would might kill them.

divisiones agrorum: after the
victory of Philippi, B.c. 42, grants

of land were made to the veterans,
municilmlibus agris (Suet. Oct. 13) ;

according to the same authority, the - '

veterans were much dissatisfied‚ for
which reason some have proposed to
change fecere into cepere. These

were the grants referred to in Ver· μ · ·

gil's first eclogue.

2. sane: concessive, it is true.

Brutorum : 2'.e. Marcus and Deci·
mus.

quamquam, ond yet.
death was an act of vengeance,
which, however, might well have
been spared on public grounds.

Pompeium, etc.: the terms
agreed upon with Sextus Pom·
peius at the treaty of Misenum,
B.c. 39, were not sulfilled. The al-
lusion to Lepidus refers to his being
gradually crowded out> of his au-
thority, rather than to any specific
act of bad saith.

post: here an adverb. This re·
lates in time only to poenas exsol-
visse, as the treaties here mentioned
came before the overthrow of Pom-
peius and Lepidus, both of which
events took place ΒΩ. 36.

sororis: Antony married Octa-

Their
