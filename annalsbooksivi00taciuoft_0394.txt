TAcrrUS. [Boon v.

on his side, made a direct attack upon him. Giving out that he was about ’
to bestow the tribunician power upon him,—in order that he might take
him unawares, — he brought accusations against him before the senate
through Naevius Sertorius Macro, whom he had secretly commissioned to
command the body-guard, and to whom he had given authority to do what· ’

ever should be necessary. And Macro coming by night to Rome, as if x
on some other business, laid his commands before the consul Memmius · '[

Regulus1 (for his colleague was of the party of Sejanus), and Graecinus
Laco, commander of the night-guards3 and going in the morning to the
palace2 (for the session of the senate was to be held in the temple of
Apollo), he met Sejanus, who had not yet entered the ha11; and seeing
that he was greatly disturbed because Tiberius had sent no message to him,

he reassured him, by telling him in private that he brought him the tribu· · ἶ

nician power. And he, recovering his spirits at this news, tripped into the

senate-house; but Macro sent the guardsmen who were about Sejanus 'and ⁷ ³
the senate back to the camp, announcing to them that he was to be their γ ⁴

commander, and saying that he brought letters from Tiberius giving dona-

their stead, he entered it, and, giving the letter to the consuls, went away
before any part of it was read3 then, directing Laco to command the guard,
there, he hastened to the camp, for fear there might be some outbreak.

contain any connected accusation against Sejanus, but first some other
matter, and then a slight censure of him, and after this something else,
and then again something against him 3 and at last it declared that two

senators who were intimate with him should be punished and he himself z

put in prison. For Tiberius did not at once order him to be put to death
—not that he did not wish it, but because he feared that some disturbance

would arise from it ; and, on the ground that he could not make the jour· ἔ

the purport of the letter, and thereupon many strange things were to be ⁴ Ξ

seen and heard. For in the first place, before it was read, all spoke in
high praise of him [Sejanus], expecting that he was about to receive the
tribunician power, and shouted in applause —- anticipating what they ex-
pected, and wishing to show him that they themselves were ready to give
it to him ; but when nothing of this sort followed, but everything that they ’
heard was just the opposite of what they expected, they fell into great .

embarrassment and dejection. Some who were sitting on the bench with “ ’
