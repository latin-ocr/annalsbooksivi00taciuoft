xxxvi INTRODUCTIQN.

lubrico paludum, in the slippery marslc, Ι. 65. 6 3 levis cohortium,
the light cohorts, ΙΙΙ. 39. 1.

e. The genitive of reference with adjectives is very common 3
e.g. furandi melior, better in pilfering, III. 74. 1 3 occultos eon-
silii, reticent about plans, VI. 36. 3.

f. Tacitus shares with the poets a fondness for the dative
case, especially the dative of service or purpose (very common s
in the gerundive)‚ of agency, and the dative as substituted for
ad with the accusative 3 thus we find it not infrequently as end
of motion3 e.g. Gaius Caesar componendae Armeniae deligitur,
Gaius Caesar is selected to put in order the affairs of Armenia,
ΙΙ. 4. 2 3 qui tributo aderant, who had come sor tribute, IV. 72.

would see under the sursace, I. 32. 7 3 paci firmator, confirmer

intentantes, eausam discordiae, threatening with their hands, a
cause of discord, Ι. 27. 1.

lz. The use of the accusative, ablative‚ and locative to express
local relations of rest or of motion to or from a place, used reg-
ularly only with towns and small islands‚ is extended by the
poets and by Tacitus to the largest islands, and even to coun-
tries, and other names of places3 e.g. remeantem Armenia, on
his way home from Armenia, I. 3. 3 3 Aegyptum proficiscitur,
(ze proceeds to Egypt, ΙΙ. 59. 1 3 campo aut litore, on plain or
shore, IV. 74. 6.

i. In the use of prepositions his fondness for figurative ex·
pressions is very marked 3 e.g. apud for cum, and in the sense
of ‘ in ’3 inter like an ablative absolute or a clause3 citra for
sine (not in the Annals) 3 circa and super, meaning “in re-
