mem reppererit. Acribus namque custodiis domum et 6
vias Saepserat Livia, laetique interdum nuntii vulgaban-
tur, donec provisis quae tempus monebat simul exces-
sisse *Augustum et rerum potiri Neronem fama eadem
tulit.

Primum facinus novi principatus fuit. Postumi Agrip- 6
pae caedeS, quem ignarum inermumque quamvis firmatus
animo centurio aegre confecit. Nihil de ea re Tibe- 2
rius apud senatum disseruit3 patris iussa simulabat,
quibus praescripsisset tribuno custodiae adposit0, ne

- cunctaretur Agrippam morte adficere, quandoque ipse

supremum diem explevisset. Multa sine dubio saevaque 3
Augustus de moribus adulescentis questUS, ut exsilium
eius senatus consulto sanciretur perfecerat; ceterum in

nepoti pro securitate privigni inlatam credibile erat.
Propius vero Tiberium ac Liviam, illum metu, hanc 4

apud, in. Intr. 35 i. with the knowledge of Tiberius or
Nolam: an important city in not.
Campania. custodiae: best taken as dative

6. namque: this word regularly

aegre confecit: this appears to

read to him.

2. patris iussa: Suetonius says
that it was doubtful whether it was
Augustus that issued the orders or
Livia; and, if she, whether it was

of the end, -placed over him as a
guard.

quandoque, as soon as—-prop-
erly wlcenever.

3. saeva questus: according to
Suetonius (Oct. 65), he spoke of
him and the two Julias — his daugh-
ter and her daughter -— as tres vomi-
cas ac tria carcinomata sua.

duravit, hardened himself

propius vero: we have seen
that Suetonius partly confirms Tibe-
rius’ own statement, that the aet was
ordered by Augustus 3 but the most
probable theory is that the respon·
sibility was assumed by Livia, and
that Tiberius was obliged to acqui-
