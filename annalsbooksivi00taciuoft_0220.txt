at the present day in the same
hieroglyphics.

odores: spices and persumes.

81. Memnonis saxea effigies:
this was a colossal statue of King
Amenophis III. of the 18th dynasty,
sixty feet in height, cut from a sin·
gle block of granite. It was be-
lieved by the Greeks to represent
the hero Memnon, son of Eos, slain
in the Trojan war; and the sound
heard at suni-ise was explained as
his salutation to his mother, the
Dawn. The name Memnon would
seem to have been an easy confu-
sion of sound with Amenoplzis,· the
sounds heard were probably caused
by some expansion of the stones in
the heat of the sun.

pyramides. these works of the
4th dynasty are in the neighborhood
of Memphis.

lacus: the lake, ot reservoir, of

Moeris, somewhat further up the
river, constructed by a king of
the 12th dynasty, about 2200 B.C.
This also has been recently discov-
ered.

angustiae . . . altitudoz sc. flu-
minis: this refers to the first cata-
ract, where the river is narrow and
so swift that it cannot be sounded.

spatiis: i.e. of line.

2. Elephantinen ac Syenen:
the proper limits of Egypt towards
Ethiopia.

rubrum ad mare: the Indian
Ocean, comprehending also the Ara·
bian and Persian Gulfs. The refer-
ence is to the expedition of Trajan,
A..D 116, when he launched upon
the Persian Gulf, which he had now
made the boundary of his empire.
This passage, therefore, gives a clew
to the date of composition of the
Annals (Intr- 2).
