*A house, and honored greatly, turned its back upon him as he was sacrificing
to it. [There is here a short gap in the manuscript.] . . . And now
sp ⁷ others began to be suspicious 3 but, not knowing the purpose of Tiberius,
Ἴ and taking into consideration the fiery temper of Sejanus, and the uncer-
.- ·’ tainty of affairs, they were in a dilemma, secretly consulting for their own
- safety, but in public paying court to him, especially because Tiberius con·
⁷ 3 ferred priestly offices upon both him and his son along with Gaius1;
therefore they gave him the proconsular power, and voted in addition that
· ‘ all who should be consuls should take him as their model in governing.
ἑ. Therefore Tiberius, although he honored him with the priesthood, did not
-, sammon him to him, but even when he asked leave to go to Campania on
·· ‚the ground that his betrothed was sick, he bade him remain where he was,
as he himself was intending soon to repair to Rome.
’ g* 8. This depressed Sejanus still more, and especially because Tiberius, in
“ appointing Gaius to a priesthood, commended him in high terms, and
Α ahowed that he regarded him as his successor. And he would have excited
a revolution, especially as the soldiers were ready to obey him in every-
², thing, if he had not seen that the people were greatly pleased at what had
been said about Gaius, in consideration of his father Germanicus. He had
⁷ before thought that they too were on his side, but now he was discouraged,
ζ’ perceiving that they were enthusiastically devoted to Gaius. And now he
s *regretted not having seized the power during his consulship.2 Others
¹ 'were influenced moreover by the fact that Tiberius acquitted an enemy of
g '⁵ his, who had been appointed to the government of Spain ten years before,
’ · and *then accused by him upon some charges ; and that he gave orders
, “ that in future those who were to govern provinces or perform any other
,1, public service, should not be· prosecuted on such grounds during their
'‹ “’ „ffioep And when he wrote to the senate concerning the death of' Nero,
³⁴ he mentioned Sejanus merely by his name, without any of the terms of
f honor which he was accustomed to use, and moreover forbade sacrifices to
Α be offered to any mortal (as had been done to Sejanus), even to himself,
. for many such honors had been voted to hm. He had, to be sure, pro-
hibited this before, but now he renewed it on account of Sejanus; for
⁴ what he had refused for himself he could not permit to another.
⁴2 ⁷ 9. For these reasons people began to slight him still more, and openly
{353 disregard him,'avoid him and neglect him. Tiberius therefore learning
