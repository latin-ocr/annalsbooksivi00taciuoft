was preserved to indicate the differ-

⁷ ⁷ ’ enee in origin.

Florentinis: the colony of Flo-

ξ , tentia, Florence, on the banks of

the Arno, had taken the place of
the ancient Etruscan city of Fae-
sulae, Fiesole, at the top of a steep

Clanis: this river flowed into the

> ⁵ ““ Tiber, but its sources, in the marshes

between Clusium and Arretium,

could be easily diverted into the
’ x Arno, a branch of which rose in the

same marshes 3 this would relieve

⁶¹ ἶ the inundations of the Tiber. This

region has been, in the present

'fg ⁷ century, thoroughly drained.

2. Interamnates: the inhabi-

tants οἱ Interamna, T erni, situated
upon the Nar. The falls of the

ῗ ἷ Nar at Terni, among the finest in

Europe, were made by artificially
draining the lands above, the work
of the distinguished statesman of
the third century B.C., Manius Curius

ἑ superstitio valuit, ut in sententiam Cn. Pisonis concede-
¹.. retur, qui nil mutandum censuerat. ’

Dentatus. This artificial channel
became the outlet of the Lacus
Velinus‚· and from the refusal of
the Reatini to have it blocked up,
as being the work of nature, it
would appear that they had lost the
tradition of its origin.

3. adiacentia: the ager Reati-
nus, a valley of great beauty and
fertility in the high Apennines.

sociorum: these were the inde-
pendent Italian nations in alliance
with Rome. But this alliance had
been brought to an end by the
Social War, B.C. 90, which had re-
sulted in the admission of all the
socii to Roman citizenship. The
use of the term on this occasion,
therefore, is only traditionary3 at
this period it was usually applied to
nations outside of Italy.

4. Tiberim: the god of the river ;
cf. sacra, etc., 3.

5. Pisonis: Gnaeus Piso, men-
tioned 74. 6.
