locos: the masculine plural of
this word is common for loca in
early and late writers, but rare in
the classical period.

3. prima: evidently the first
camp which they came upon, which,
it seems, was also the one occupied
by Varus after the first day's fight.
This would naturally be the case if
Germanicus approached from the
north, the valley of the Ems.

principiis: the via princzPalis,
or main street, running across the
camp from north to south, separat-
ing the part (about one-third of its
area) which contained the officers'
quarters, stores, etc„ from that occu-
pied by the troops. As the camp

. was-laid out by fixed rules and of defi-

nite proportions, the length of the

princzpia showed the size of the army.
dein: the second camp.
semiruto vallo, etc.: the camp

was constructed in haste, and, there·

fore. quickly feu into ruins.

., Igitur Romanus qui aderat exercitus 62
· sextum post cladis annum trium legionum ossa, nullo

accisae, diminislzed,· the second
camp was laid out after a day’s
fighting, with heavy losses.

medio campi: i.e. the field of
the third day's fight, after they had
left the second camp.

4. ora: no doubt human skulh,
as this word would not properly be
used for horses.

5. primorum ordinum centu·
tiones: these officers commanded
the cohorts, and ranked next to the
tribunes.

mactaverant: Tacitus speaks of
human sacrifices (Germ. 9).

6. referebant, related.

patibula: forked pieces of wood
to which slaves and criminals were
fastened‚ as to a cross, by their arms
and feet.

serobes: for burying alive.

er superbiam: Intr. 35 i.
2. qui aderat exercitus: re-
peated from 61. 1, for rhetorical

effect. NipperdeY.
