5 vacantia teneret.

gravior, etc.: his remedies were
more dangerous than the disorders
that they sought to abolish.

subversor: his consulship was
in violation of the law which re-
quired an interval of ten years
between two successive occupations
of the same magistracy (he had
been consul B.C. 55). Moreover,
after procuring the passage of a law
forbidding the candidacy of any per-
son absent from the city, he inserted
a clause in the law, making an ex*
ception in the case of Caesar3 the
clause was, of course, legally invalid.
He also used his personal influence
to secure the acquittal of Metellus
Scipio on a charge of bribery.

quae armis tuebatur: from the
year of his second consulship (B.C.
55) he held the proconsulship of
Spain, which he governed by legati,
remaining himself in the neighbor-
hood of Rome. During his third
consulship, therefore (B.C. 52), he
was at once consul and proconsul,
and thus armed with extraordinary
military power.

armis amisit: by the civil war
with Caesar.

2. per viginti annos: in round
numbers; the civil war began B.C.
49, and was finally ended by the

Sed altius penetrabant urbemque et

victory of Augustus at Actium, B.C.
31. The reign of force did not,
however, cease until the formal es-
tablishment of the empire, B.C. 27.

exitio: especially in the proscrip-
tions in the Second Triumvirate (of
Antony, Lepidus, and Caesar Octa-
vianus).

3. sexto consulatu: B.C. 28 (see
note on Ι. 1. 3 and 2. 1).

quae . . . iusserat: the violent and
illegal measures of the triumvirate.

iura, the rule qflaw. ,

pace et principe ε object of
uteremur ε the emperor was the
guaranty of peace‚—l'empire ,c'est
la paix.

4. acriora . . .
vere restraints.

custodes: sc. legum .· referring
to the infor-mers, through whom the
machinery of the laws was set in
motion (see Intr. 13). The law ex-
cluded the unmarried from inbcri-
tance3 the childless received only
half of the property; while a large
share fell to the informer. The rest
went to the state (populus vacan-
tia teneret).

vacantia: having no legal heir.

5. penetrabant: i.e. the inform·
ers; they began to assail all citizens,
wherever they were.
