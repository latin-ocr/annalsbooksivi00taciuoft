nation that has not changed its residence or name from that time
to this. The natural approach to their country was up the valley
of the Main3 and at the mouth of this river, upon the Rhine,
at Moguntiacum (Mentz), the Romans established the head-
quarters of one division of their army. ι

At the northern extremity of the mountains dwelt the Tenc-
teri 3 and at this important strategic point on the western bank,
the German tribe of the Ubii had received lands, ut arcerent,
non ut custodirentur (Germ. 28). Here were the headquar-
ters of the lower army, until, A.D. 50, the oppidum of the Ubii
was made a Roman colony (see I. 31. 3n.), named Colonia
Agm‘ppz'na, in honor of the empress Agrippina, who was born
there. ,The legions were now removed to Bonn, a few miles
further up the river. The chief military position, however,
upon the Lower Rhine‚ was about sixty miles below, where
the river Lippe flows into the Rhine from the east. The
valley of this river formed the natural approach to the country ,
of the Cherusci (the nation of Arminius) as the Main did to
the country of the Chatti. North of the Lippe dwelt the
Usipetes and Bructeri, but the country between the Lippe ,
and the Ruhr, a few miles further south, appears to have - ’
remained, for some distance back from the Rhine, in the hands
of the Romans. (See Ι. 50. 2 n.) Still further east, and
south of the Lippe, the Tubantes occupied the lands from
which the Sugambrians had been removed by Tiberius (II. 26.
3 n.) ς the Tubantes had before been north of the Lippe. The
military road from the Rhine into the heart of Germany was
necessarily, like the modern railroad, carried along the banks
of the Lippe ; and opposite the mouth of this river was estab-
lished the principal camp of the lower army—at Vetera (sc.
castra), as that of the upper army was opposite the mouth
of the Main. All the military operations of Germanicus, except
a single short campaign against the Chatti, had this camp as
their base of operations. ’

In the second year, A.D. 15, after this campaign against
