diderat3 cunctaque eius dicta factaque, cum prohibere
posset, scire malebat, donec Iunius quidam, temptatus ut
infernas umbras carminibus eliceret, ad Fulcinium Trio-
nem indicium detulit. Celebre inter accusatores Trionis 4
ingenium erat avidumque famae malae. Statim corripit

temptatus: i.e. by Libo.
infernas . . . eliceret: a form

momentous occasions ; as in the

28.

Fulcinium Trionem: see III.
ιο. 1, and 13. 2.

indicium detulit: this was the
first step in the procedure, which, it
will be remembered, regularly ema-
nated from private persons (Intr. 15
and 16). The witness (index) laid
his testimony before the professional
accuser, who then brought the case
before the magistrates (adit con-
sules).

4. corripit, indicts,· a term prop-
erly used for physical arrest‚ but
common in this sense.

adit consules: see Ι. 72. 4 n, and
73. 3 n.

cognitionem.- the term properly
used for a trial by the senate, as

the courts.

29. veste mutata, puttz'ng on
mourning, —perhaps not formal
mourning, the toga pulla, but with
neglected robes, toga sordida.

vocem, counsel,· finding none,
he was obliged to enter the senate
house sine patrono ‚· see next
chapter.

2. fratri: Lucius Libo, consul or-
dinarius of the year (1. 1). He is
not mentioned here as consul, be·
cause his term expired July 1, while
the trial took place in September
(32. 4). The practice was intro-
duced by the triumvirs‚ B.C. 39, and
in the reign of Augustus it became
the custom, to elect the consuls for
only a part of ⁴the year, usually six
months (Ι. 55. 1 n). After the
reign of Tiberius, it was common
to have three or four pairs of con·
suls or even more in a year. See
Mommsen, Ram. St. ΙΙ. p. 79.

libellos, documents.
