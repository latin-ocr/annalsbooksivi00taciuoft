Nec is libidini finis: traditam Tiberio pervicax

adulter contumacia et odiis in maritum accendebat;
litteraeque, quas Iulia patri Augusto c-um insectatione
6 Tiberii scripsit, a Graccho compositae credebantur. Igi-

2. imparem: although the Clau-
dian gens was as noble as the Julian,
and far more noble than that of
Julia’s first husband, Agrippa, it had
not yet any recognized rank as a
royal family. See Intr. 26.

Rhodum: see 4. 4 and notes.

3. Postumum Agrippam: her
youngest son (6. 1); his death de-
prived her of all hope of regaining
her freedom.

inopia ac tabe longa: Suetonius
says (Tib. 50): peculio concesso a
patre praebitisque annuis fraudavit.
On the other hand, in 11 he says
that Tiberius' sense of justice was so
great that, after his divorce from
Julia‚ he interceded with her father
for her, and left to her, utcumque
meritae, whatever he had given
her. The present statement is,
therefore, probably untrue or ex-
aggerated.

4. familia nobili. . . facundus:

these three phrases illustrate Taci-
tus' fondness for variety of expres-
sion (Intr. 35 r).

prave facundus, eloquent, but
unscrupulous,· he employed his
eloquence in the support of bad
causes.

5. traditam: i.e. in marriage 3 it
agrees with eam, understood as the
object of accendebat.

6. Africi maris: in the Lesser
Syrtis (near Tripoli).

quattuordecim annis: a rare
ablative of length of time. This
diserepancy (of a single year) be·
tween the period of his banishment
and Julia's may be explained by the
supposition that he was the tribune
of the plebs mentioned by Dio (LV.
10), whose banishment was deferred
to the end of his magistracy. Or
he may have been put to death by

Augustus.
