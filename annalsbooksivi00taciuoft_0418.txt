uam.
q publicum consilium: an old
name for the senate, derived from
its original functions as a counsel-
ling body. Cf. Cic. de Rep. II. 8.
ῐ4; [Romulus] in regium consi-
lium delegerat principffi, qui appel-
lati sunt propter caritatem patres.

16. magna vis accusatorum:
it appears from a passage in Dio
Cassius (LVIII. 21) that this was
done at the instigation of the em-
peror, whose habit it was to insist
upon arigid enforcement of, the
laws; as he had shown himself (III.
53, 54) to have a keen appreciation
of the social and economieal evils
of the time, we may suppose that
his enforcement of this law was
grounded in considerations of pub-
lic policy. The result, however, was
very unfortunate.

adversum legem dictatoris
Caesaris: we have no knowledge
of any usury laws, or laws regulating
the rate of interest, of Julius Caesar.
Dio, however (XLI. 38), mentions
a law of his forbidding any person
to possess (κεκτῆσθαι), more than

15‚ooo drachmas [= denarii] in
gold or silver, and we may infer

with some probability that that is>

the law referred to. The descrip-
tion is too vague to warrant us in
any positive conclusions; but we

may infer that if it prohibited keep· ⁷

ing on hand more than a certain
amount of cash, it may have regu·
lated the investment of the balance.
It is referred to in the other pas·
sage of Dio (LVIII. 21) as a law
περὶ τῶν συμβολαίων, which may
very well apply to such loans (de
modo credendi possidendique).

omissam olim, which had long
ago become obsolete.

2. vetus urbi: ale. common in old
times. Livy’s history mentions many
instances of distress and disturbance
arising from the exaction of usury,
and the harsh enforcement of the
laws of debt.

3. unciario faenore: the view
of Niebuhr is now generally adopted,
that this was an uncia for an ας,-
i.e. one-twelfth of the principal, or
eight and one-third per cent, for the
year. Niebuhr further assumes,
which is not so certain, that this
