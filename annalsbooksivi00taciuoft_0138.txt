2 Nomen patris patriae Tiberius, a populo saepius inges-
tum, repudiavit; neque in acta sua iurari quamquam
censente senatu permisit, cuncta mortalium incerta,
quantoque plus adeptus foret, tanto se magis in lu-

brico dictitans,

Non tamen ideo faciebat fidem civilis

animi; nam legem maiestatis reduxerat, cui nomen apud

der the empire, the full honor of
a triumph was reserved to the em·
peror himself, or in rare cases (as
Germanicus, and Titus, son of Ves-
pasian) to members of his family.
Others received only the orna·
menta, by which is meant the right
to appear at festivals, etc., in the
distinctive dress or other character-
istics of an office. The triumphalia
insignia were properly the vestis
triumphalis (i.e. toga picta and
tunica palmata), the laurel wreath,
and the triumphal chair, chariot and
sceptre. But even during the re-
public, the triumphal garments and
chair were seldom granted as orna·
menta, the chariot and sceptre never.
In the empire, the laurel wreath,
too, was restricted to the emperor,
and became his crown; the trium-
phalia ornamenta were nOW, there·
fore, nothing but a name, and he who
received them had, so far as external
insignia are concerned, ‘only the
right to the ordinary toga praetexta
of the magistrate. (Momm. R‘o‘m.
St. Ι. 353.) At the same time the
dignity of triumphalis was highly
valued, and was transmitted to pos-
terity.

2. patris patriae: this title was
granted to Julius Caesar, and after-
wards (B.C. 2) to Augustus. Tibe-
rius persistently declined it (see II.
87. 2), as did certain of his succes-
sors (eg. Nero, Vespasian, Hadrian)
in the early part of their reigns3 but
it became at last a regular part of the
emperor’s titles. Suetonius (Tib. 67)

puts in the mouth of Tiberius an
explanation which is creditable to
his modesty, and at the same time
illustrates his characteristic -self-dis-
trust: si quando . . . de moribus
meis devotoque vobis animo dubita-
veritis (quod priusquam eveniat,
opto ut me supremus dies lzuic mu-
tatae vestrae de me opinioni eripiat)
nihil lionoris adiciet milti patria
appellatio. The words that follow,
quanto . . . dictitans, also illustrate
this feeling of his.

ingestum: i.e. by acclamation
(F urneaux).

in acta sua iurari: the acta of

the emperor were his civil acts, not g ³· 'l

properly including, however, his
iegsregularly taken on the Ist of
January, the oath including the acts
of past emperors, so far as these

had not been annulled. The oath
was afterwards made to include the

future acts of the prinee (Momm.

Rb'm. St. ΙΙ. 847), and it may be that
these were included on the present
occasion, from the words cuneta
mortalium ineerta, and from the
motive attributed to him by Sueto·
nius (T ib. 67), ne mox maiore de-
decore impar tantis honoribus inve-
niretur, his words being exempli
causa cavendum esse ne se Senatus
in acta cuiusquam obligaret, qui ali-
quo casu mutari posset.
