THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE GERMAN CAMPAIGNS.

GERMANJCUS conducted operations against the Germans during
three yearS‚ Aa). 14, 15 and 16. The campaign of the first
year was hardly more than a reconnaissance, having as its prin-
cipal object to divert the minds of the soldiers from the recent

= tragedies, and inspirit them by success. It was directed against

the Marsi, a nation who bordered the Chatti upon the north, and
who, a's we are informed by Strabo (VII. p. 290) had moved
back into the interior Of the country, μεταστάντα εἷς Τὴν ἐν βάθει Δ
χώραν, probably at the time that Tiberius established the limes,

⁴ or military frontier‚ spoken of Ι. 5ο. The Marsi were south of

the Lippe, and probably upon the upper waters of the Ruhr.
The operations of the two following years had as their
obJect partly to avenge the defeat of Varus in the Teutoburg
Forest (Aa). 9), and partly to recover the territory lost at that
time. Drusus, father of Germanicus, had conquered Germany

as far as the Elbe, and established the province of Germania

(B.c. 12). All of this territory, with some trifling exceptions,
was lost by the defeat of Varus, and the military force of the
province was withdrawn to the left bank of the Rhine, where
it was, strictly speaking, within the boundaries of the Gallie
province of Belgica.

In order to understand these campaigns it is necessary to
cast a glance at the geographical situation (see Map). The
river Rhine flows from Mentz to Cologne through a picturesque
mountain region, unsuited to military operations. The country
east of the river was here occupied by the powerful tribe of
the Chatti, the modern Hessians,—-almost the only German
