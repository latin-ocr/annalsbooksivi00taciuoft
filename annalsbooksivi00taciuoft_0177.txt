duum sibi, cetera legatis permisit.

Quibus plana eve· 3

nerant, facile inrupere; quis impugnandus agger, ut si
murum succederent, gravibus superne ictibus conflicta-

bantur.

Sensit dux imparem comminus pugnam, re· 4

motisque paulum legionibus funditores libritoresque

excutere tela et proturbare hostem iubet.

Missae e 5

tormentis hastae, quantoque conspicui magis propugna-
tores, tanto pluribus vulneribus deiecti.

Primus Caesar cum praetoriis cohortibus capto vallo 6
dedit impetum in silvas ; collato illic gradu certatum.
Hostem a tergo paluS, Romanos flumen aut montes 7
claudebant: utrisque necessitas in loco, spes in virtute,

salus ex victoria.

Nec minor Germanis animuS, sed 21

genere pugnae et armorum superabantur, cum ingens
multitudo artis locis praelongas hastas non protenderet,
non colligeret, neque adsultibus et velocitate corporum
uteretur, coacta stabile ad proelium: contra mileS, cui

aggerem eniteretur: for the ac·
cusative, cf. Ι. 30. 2 (egredi), 1. 61. 6
(elabi), III. 14. 5 (evadere).

arduum: sc. erat3 zle. the as-
sault upon the agger.

sibi: with permisit, or rather,
by zeugma, some word like sumpsit.

3. plana: i.e. the aequus aditus.

superne: the use of an adverb
as ‘an attributive adjective, found
also in Livy ; cf. comminus below.

4. funditores libritoresque: the
former were regular slingers, who
cast pebbles and leaden bullets,
glandes ,· the libritores used leather
thongs, lora, and hurled large
stones. When the defenders had
been dislodged from the rampart by
these missiles and those from the
engines, the legions were again
brought up.

attack after the capture of the

they had passed the agger, they still
met a stubborn resistance.
