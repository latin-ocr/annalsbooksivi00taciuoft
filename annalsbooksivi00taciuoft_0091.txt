tractui-is: see Appendix, 1.

Intr. 18. 16. The army of Upper
Germany took no part in the mutiny.

agendo censui: ie. levying the

Δ. ‚ tribute, which was based upon an

assessment of property, census.
An annual tribute, stipendium, of
forty million sesterces (ss2‚000‚000),
had been imposed by Julius Caesar
upon the conquered Gauls. The
plural Galliarum is used to desig·
nate the three divisions of Gaul.

3. quibus Silius moderabatur:
i.e. those of Upper Germany.

alienae: i.e. of the army of
‘Lower Germany.

unetvicensimanis, etc.: the le-
gions of Lower Germany were the
I. (Germanica, afterwards Miner-
via); V. (Alauda, afterwards Mace-
donica); XX. (Valeria Victrix),
and XXI. (Rapax).

Ubiorum: this German tribe or
nation had entered 1nto alliance
with Caesar (B. G. IV. 16), and
had been settled by Agrippa on the
left bank of the Rhine, where their
chief town was afterwards made a
Roman colony, Colonia Agrippina
(Cologne), named in honor of the

Igitur audito fine Augusti vernacula

granddaugh'ter of Agrippa, the
younger Agrippina. This was the
first example of a policy, which after·
wards became common, of settling
German tribes upon lands on the
frontier‚ on the condition of render-
ing military service. Such settlers
were in the later times of the em·
pire called laeti, and their lands
terrae laeticae.

4. vernacula: this word has
generally been interpreted in this
passage to mean the lower classes of
the city, as Dio says (LVII. 5), ἐκ
τοῦ ἀστικοῦ ὄχλου . . . οἱ πλείους
ἦσαν. This seems to agree with it‘s
classical meaning, native, vernacu-
lar,· the word is not found until the
third century A.D. with a significa-
tion cognate to verna, “ belonging
to a slave‚'' “slavish.’' Mommsen
shows (Hermes, XIX., 1884), that
in military relations vernaculus has
a peculiar and technical meaning,
being used to designate troops
(legiones vernaculae) composed os
persons who were not Roman citi·
zens when enrolled, but who received
citizenship upon enlistment, thus
maintaining the principle that the
legions, as distinguished from the
auxiliary corps, were always com·

posed of citizens. According to
