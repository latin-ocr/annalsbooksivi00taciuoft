provincial life. In this cult Rome was regularly associated with
Augustus, and no very nice distinction appears to have been
made between divus Augustus and the reigning emperor, who
also was lawfully known as Augustus.¹

26. It was a matter of course that some of the sacredness
of the present deity attached to the members of his family.
Augustus, as adopted son of Julius Caesar, called himself Divi
filz'us,· and it may be that here is found in part the explana-
tion of the contempt which Julia, daughter of Augustus, felt
for her husband Tiberius (I. 53), for Tiberius was not as yet
adopted into the imperial family.

The relations between the several members of this family are
shown in the table on page xxix. The following (besides ’
Tiberius) appear prominently in the Annals :

a. Livia, the mother of the emperor, was a woman of great personal
beauty‚ and an ambitious, domineering spirit, apparently not one who
would scruple long at any means to secure her ends. She exereised a great
ascendency over her husband, and expected to exercise the same over her
son; and nothing in the history of Tiberius is more noteworthy than the
effort he made to preserve the due balance between the dutiful affection
for his mother, characteristic of Roman family life, and his determination
to keep the reins of government in his own hands (see I. 725 ΙΙ. 3‘43 ΙΙΙ.
17. 643 IV.57; V. 1). Α

b. Germanicus, son of Drusus, and adopted by his uncle Tiberius. A
brave, honorable man, of genial temper and great personal popularity. A
good but not a great commander. His early death prevents us from knowing
with certainty what his capacities were.

c. Drusus, son of Tiberius, a man of strong will and the capacity to
command. He, too, died young, and his death is one of the most pathetic
incidents in the narration. If he had lived, it seems certain that he would
have been an able and energetic ruler; but the sternness of temper which
in Tiberius developed into cruelty only at the very close of his life, was a
predominant characteristic of his son from the first, and would probably
have made him a tyrant.

d. Agrippina, daughter of Marcus Agrippa and Julia, and wife of
Germanicus. A woman of high spirit and ambition, and of unblemished
personal character. It is impossible for us to know whether her ambition
