it is plain that the speaker could not have had in mind the death of Ger-
manicus, but the ruin of his family.

BOOK VI.

2. 6. suaderez the MS. has suaderet, which many editors retain,
inserting ut after neque. suadere is historical infinitive.

5. 1. incertae: the manuscript reading is incerta ‚· with this change
the meaning is perfeetly plain ; but some editors change to incestae, or
read Gaiam for Gaium, in order to make the affront more cutting.

11. 6. viginti: this is by some editors altered to quindecim, because a
story told by Suetonius (Tib. 42) and Pliny (N. H. XIV. 22. 145) ascribes
his appointment to Tiberius. But Mommsen points out that Tiberius was
censor, and received the tribunician power, Λα). 13. At any rate this story
is a very insufficient reason for altering the text.

28. 4. alios tres Sesoside: this is Halm's reading for the MS. aliter
esse sosi de. Rhenanus proposed alites.

81( 4. ut . . . ut: some editors change the first ut to et: some omit
the second ut.

33. 2. Parthorum: the manuscript reads Parthorumque ‚· some
editors join que with dat3 others read Medorum Parthorumque, on ac-

’ count of the mention of Medes (34. 6). But in this passage, Medorum

is evidently used as a general expression of contempt for the effeminate

v ' Oriental troops; cf. 34. 6 n.

 

47. 1. exitium: this reading of Nipperdey, for the MS. exilium, which
he rejected as inconsistent with futuris caedibus, above, has been 'gener-
gualistogiegatris: this word is by most editors emended to patrum ‚· but
as Pfitzner points out, the word communem is best explained by suppos-
ing it to be either her own father, or the father of her son— her divorced
husband.
