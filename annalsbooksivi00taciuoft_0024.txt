χχ ’ INTRODUCI'IONL

the plebs served to a certain extent as prosecuting officers in
offences of a political character 3 but ordinary crimeS, and,
aster the establishment of the quaestiones perpetuae by Sulla, all
classes of crimes, were left to the interest or public ’spirit of
individuals. If individuals did not take them up, they went
unpunished. Hence the dangerous resource of inviting indi-
viduals to search out and indict criminals, by rewarding them
in case of conviction 3 the result of which was that delation in
cases of treason became a regular profession. Tiberius, who,
as Merivale points out (Vol. IV. p. 130, chap. 44), was very
much of a pedant, and who lacked the originality of mind to
devise any substitute for this procedure of the Republic, seems
to have believed that the only security for justice was to carry

out the laws with the utmost rigor, but to mitigate their severity κ

after conviction by the liberal exercise of his power of pardon-

30, 66), and by reproving or punishing delators who should be ,

actuated by malice or rapacity (III. 19, 56 3 IV. 31, 36 3 VI. 30).
We note during his first years a constant effort to moderate the
severity to which the senate was disposed. In the last part of
his reign he seldom showed this merciful or forgiving spirit, and
the mischiefs which are inherent in the system of delations had

full scope.
THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

17. The Roman Empire at the accession of Tiberius em-
braced all the lands in the circuit of the Mediterranean Sea
except Mauretania, Thrace, Lycia, and Rhodes. Cappadocia
was added to the empire during the reign of Tiberius 3 these
other countries, together with Britain, under Caligula and Clau—
dius. The empire was sharply divided into two portions‚ — the
ruling part, or Rome (now extended so as to comprise the
whole of Italy, as well as the Roman colonies and municipia
outside of Italy), and the subject part, the provinces. The
provinces, twenty-eight in number, were administered by gov-
