TACITUS.

mercus Scaurus et L. Arruntius aliique Sullae propinqui

exempla maiorum, qui iuventutis irreverentiam gravibus
‘decretis notavissent, donec Drusus apta temperandis
animis disseruit, et satisfactum Corbuloni per Mamer-

Idem Corbulo plurima per

Italiam itinera fraude mancipum et incuria magistra-

this was not done until the reign of
Claudius.

6. patruus, vitricus, uncle (on
the father's side, Scaurus and the
elder Sulla being half—brothers), step-
sather (Scaurus having married the
widowed mother of Sulla). He had
himself been before married to Le·
pida (23. 3). This Sulla was de-
scended from the Publius Sulla whom
Cicero defended in an extant ora-
tion.

saeviebat: in the reign of Calig-
ula Corbulo allowed himself, by these

prosecutions, to be made an agent
of gross extortion (Dio, LIX. 15);
but the sums extorted were refunded
by Claudius (id. LX. 17).

iudicio patrum: Africa, al-
though it had an army, was a sena-
torial province (see Intr. 18. A. 2),
and the governor was regularly ap-
pointed by lot; the two oldest con-
sulares being assigned to the two
wealthiest and most honorable sena-
torial provinces, Africa and Asia. On
this occasion, owing to the military
exigency, Africa was withdrawn from
the lot, and Lepidus, the oldest con-
sular, was to receive Asia in course.
This gave an opportunity to his
enemy, Pompeius, to urge that this
province too should be made an ex·
ception: the judgment of the em·
