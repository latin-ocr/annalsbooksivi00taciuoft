adopted into the Livian gens, prob-
ably by the distinguished tribune of
B.c.9 1 , Marcus Livius Drusus‚whence
he bore the name Marcus Livius
Drusus Claudianus. The empress,
therefore, while of the blood of the
patrician Claudii, was a Livia by the
adoption ofher father3 and was after-
wards, by the will of her husband (1.
8. 2), adopted into the Julian gens,
receiving the name Julia Augusta.

brief episode in the civil wars of
the second triumvirate, set on foot
by Fulvia, the wife of Mark Antony,
and his brother Lucius, against Oc-
tavian, B.C. 41. It was ended by
the capture of Perusia (the modern
Perugia), after which, according to
tradition, the soldiers of Octavian
exhibited great cruelty. The peace
(of short duration) made by the tri-
umvirs with Sextus Pompeius, was
two years afterwards, B.C. 39.

3. gravidam: her younger son
Drusus, father of Germanicus, was
born after her marriage to Caesar3
