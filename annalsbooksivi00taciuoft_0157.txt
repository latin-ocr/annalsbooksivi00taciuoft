1. Tauro: his full name was

¹ ι γ Titus Statilius Sisenna Taurus ; the
, = . order here found (the gentile name
ἶ 1 between the two cognomina) is so

unusual with Tacitus that the edi-
tors consider the last cognomen to

 · be a gloss.

mota, stirred up, for commota

’ ⁷ (Intr. 35 b).

provmciae Romanae: the only

’ ''f- Roman province in the East at this

time, except in Asia Minor and
Egypt, was Syria, which embraced

· also Phoenicia and Judaea, being
ξ . bounded on the east by the Eu-

phrates and the desert.

Parthos: the Parthians were a
nation of mountaineers, who lived
southeast of the Caspian Sea.

After the breaking up of Alexan-

der’s empire, they gained their in-
dependence under Arsaces (about

‘'j'' - ΒΩ. 250), but their kingdom was not

greatly enlarged until the time of
Mithridates 1., about the middle of

the second century before Christ.

He took advantage of the collapse
of the empire of the Seleucidae, after
the battle of Magnesia (Rc. 190),
to seize all the territory as far west
as the Euphrates. The empire of

the Parthians was the only formida-

ble rival of that of Rome, from
which it was separated by the Eu-
phrates and the Arabian desert. At
this time its power had greatly de-
cayed, but it still had sufficient
strength and prestige to make the
relations with Parthia a constant
subject of care and anxiety to the
Roman emperors.

gentis Arsacidarum: the royal
family of Parthia, descendants of
Arsaces, its first king. The cruel
and tyrannical Phraates IV. gave
four of his sons as hostages to Au·
gustus, among them this Vonones.
Phraates was murdered Rc. 2, by
his illegitimate son Phraataces‚ who
succeeded him, but was shortly set
aside for Orodes, a distant kins-
man. After his assassination, prob·
ably A.D. 7, Vonones was given to
the Parthians as king, at their re-

uest.
q 2. quamquam, etc.: Phraates
succeeded to the throne of Parthia,
B.C. 38. Two years later Mark An-
tony led an expedition against him,
and was ignominiously repulsed.

venerantium: equivalent, by a
not uncommon usage, to venera·
tionis— tlze qffices of respect. Among
other things, he had restored (B.c.
