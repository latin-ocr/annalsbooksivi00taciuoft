decemvirs and ius of the military
tribunes, as well as with the personal
potentia of the first triumvirate,
the irregular military power, arma,
of the second, and the legally recog-
nized military authority, imperium,
of the empire. No doubt, also,
Tacitus, here as elsewhere, sought
to avoid tautology by the use of
synonymous terms.

potentia . . . arma: the so-called
triumvirate of Pompey, Crassus, and
Caesar (Β. c. 60) was simply a coali-
tion of party- -leaders which estab-
lished a potentia resting upon the
personal ability or influence of its
members: this power shortly fen to
Caesar. The Second Triumvirate, of
’ Εὲῗῖἰιω, Antonius, and Caesar (Oc-
tavianus), was a commission rei
publicae constituendae formally es-
tablished by law, Nov. 27, B.C. 43,
for a period of five years. It was
then extended by the triumvirs by
their own authority for five years
longer, after which time, civil war
having broken out between them,
they continued their commands
without formal authority. Lepidus
was forced to submit to Caesar
B.C. 363 Antony, in 31.
