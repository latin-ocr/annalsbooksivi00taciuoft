legeS.

B.C. 100. Drusus, B.C. 91, grandfather
of the empress Livia, urged reforms
in the interest of the senatorial order
imelf. ²

3. corrupti, etc.: a principal item
of the proposed reforms of· Marcus
Livius Drusus (B.C. 91) was the ad-
mission of the Italian allies (socii)
to the citizenship. Their disappoint-
ment in this was the cause of the
Social or Italian War, which fol-
lowed the next year 3 and immedi-
ately after (mox) came the civil
war of Marius and Sulla.

per intercessionem: i.e. of the
tribunes. Each one of the ten tri-
bunes was invested with the power
of blocking the actions of the others;
as a result, the hopes held out by
one party were baffied by the ob-
structions placed in the way by the
other.

4. prioribus (neuter), former
measures. Sulla got the upper hand
B.c. 82, and held unlimited power for
about three years.

plura: the legislation of Sulla
was very broad and radical, in the
interest of the senate. Many of his
reforms were permanent ; a part
were soon repealed (see below).

eius rei: i.e. from the violent
changes of party and abrupt changes
in policy.

Tum Cn. PompeiUS, tertium consul corrigendis 28

turbidis Lepidi rogationibus:
ablative absolute. Marcus Lepidus,
father of the triumvir, was consul
B.C. 78, and attempted to overthrow
the legislation of Sulla.

tribunis reddita licentia: Sulla
took away from the tribunes a great
part of their power, especially in
regard to making laws; but it was
restored to them in the first consul-
ship of Pompey, B.C. 70.

5. in commune, with a general
jurisdiction,· i.e. as a permanent
institution.

in singulos homines latae
quaestiones ε not privilegia, or
laws directed against individuals
(like modern bills of attainder)‚
but, rather, special courts organized
to try individual offenders, as in the
case of Milo, B.C. 52.

corruptissima, etc.: the greatest
number of laws when society was
most corrupt.

28. tertium consul: in 13.c. 52,
after several months of anarchy,
Pompey was made sole consul (ab-
sens et solus, quod nulli alii umquam
contzgit‚ Liv. Epit. CV11.>, and pro·
ceeded to re-establish order by the
severe use of his extraordinary pow-
ers. For the last five months of the
year he took his father-in-law‚ Me-
tellus Scipio, as colleague.
