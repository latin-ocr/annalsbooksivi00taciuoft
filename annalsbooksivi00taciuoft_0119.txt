istrates were as a general thing
taken from the hereditary nobility.

ipsi: Varus.

crimina et innoxios, the
and the innocent (Intr. 35 r).

4. quamquam. ,ztractus Intr.
35 j. —consensu gentis: he was
dragged into the war against his
judgment, by the unanimity of his
people.

discors, at variance ,· i.e. with
Arminius, cf. 58. 5.

gener invisus inimici soceri:
some editors put a comma after
invisus, which would make soceri
nominative, pointing to an un·
friendly feeling between Sigimerus,

guilty

. father of Arminius, and Segestes,

father of his wife Thusnelda. There
is no occasion, however, to drag in
Sigimerus. The objection to mak-
ing soeeri genitive is that then both
epithets express the feelings of
Segestes, —an apparent tautology.
But the two adjectives express dif-
ferent degrees, and perhaps differ-
ent stages of enmity, —inimicus,
unfi‘iendly, relating purely to feel-
ing, which was perhaps of long
standing, while invisus, Izated,

suggests a specific ground of the
feeling, —his revolutionary plans,
or his elopement with his daughter.
Cf. Suet. Cal. 15: nihil sibi admis-
sum cur cuiquam invisus esset.

56. tumultuarias, hastily lev-
ied.

cis Rhenum colentium: the
Ubii, Sugambri, etc.; see note on
Ubiorum, 31. 3.

Caecinae: he was to advance,
as the sequel shows, in Germanicus'
route of the previous year, between
the Ruhr and the Lippe. He had
the army of Lower Germany.

paterni praesidii: Drusus had
established two posts,——one on Mt.
Taunus, the other (Aliso) on the
Li e.

ffionte Tauno: this is north of
the Main, near Homburg. He had
set out from Moguntiacum (Mentz),
taking with him the four legions of
Upper Germany.

expeditum: not light-armai, but
unincumbered, sc. with baggage, etc.,
so as to be capable of a rapid march
