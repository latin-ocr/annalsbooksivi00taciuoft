LANGUAGE AN D STYLE. xxxi

sonorous sentences of Johnson; the ⁸easy flow of Quintilian to
the lucidity and elegance of Prescott. The style of the Silver
Age was more colloquial—men wrote more as they talked 3
just as is the case with the English of the present day, as com-

style, there were changes in vocabulary and syntax which par-
tially obscure the result just pointed out, by cultivating forms
of expression and construction which lacked the simple dignity
of earlier writers. In other terms, while the flow of words
followed a more natural order, corresponding more closely to
the natural order of thought, the diction became more strained
and artificial. There was of course a constant flux in the
vocabulary—old words were dropped and new ones adopted.
The acquisitions were from two principal sources: the Greek
language‚ and the usages of the poets 3 and from these sources
were derived not only new words and new meanings of old
words, but, although not so abundantly, new forms of construc-
tion. The expressions borrowed from the Greek stand in the
Latinity of the Silver Age about as the contributions of F rench
and German stand in the English language‚ partly assimilated,
partly still regarded with a certain degree of suspicion. It is
the influence of the poets that is chiefly seen in these writers,
especially in Tacitus. It is to be noted that all the Latin poets
of high merit and great popularity are later than Cicero—later,
at least, than the period in which he formed his style. Their
influence was marked upon Livy, who was almost their con-
temporary: upon Tacitus it was powerful. The same tendency
towards .a figurative and brilliant style was fostered by the

longer any genuine debate, and of course no genuine oratory.
The student was trained on artificial rhetorical exercises, which
