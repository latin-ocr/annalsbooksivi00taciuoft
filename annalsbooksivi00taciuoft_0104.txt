58 TACITUS. [BOOK 1.

occisus Augusti pronepOS‚ interfecta Tiberii nurus no-
3 centiores vos faciat. Quid enim per hos dies inausum
4 intemeratumve vobis? Quod nomen huic coetui dabo?
Militesne appellem, qui filium imperatoris vestri vallo
et armis circumsedistis? an civeS, quibus tam proiecta
senatus auctoritas? Hostium quoque ius et sacra lega-
5 tionis et fas gentium rupistis. Divus Iulius seditionem
exercitus verbo uno compescuit, Quirites vocando qui
sacramentum eius detrectabant; divus Augustus vultu
et aspectu Actiacas legiones exterruit: nos ut nondum ..
eosdem, ita ex illis ortos si Hispaniae Suriaeve miles j:

4. proiecta, cast away ,· trampled
under foot.

hostium quoque ius, tlte rights
which even enemies possess.

5. Quirites, fillow-citizens: im-
plying their dismissal from service.
This incident, which occurred just
before the battle of Thapsus, ΒΩ.
46, is related by Suetonius (Iul.
70).

Actiacas: referring to a mutiny
at Brundisium shortly after the bat-
tle of Actium (Suet. Oct. 17). ⁴

eosdem, on their level. The use
of nondum may point to his ex·
pectation of the throne, or to anti·
cipated military distinction.

Hispaniae Suriaeve: he was
unknown to these3 if you were
Spanislt or Syrian soldiers, which
you are not.

indignum erat: the indicative
is regularly used in apodosis in ex-
pressions denoting possibility, pro·
priety, etc. A. δι G. 308 c.

6. illa . . . tu: addressing one of
the legions direcssy, and pointing to

the other. illa would regularly re· ’

late to the one first mentioned3 but ’

the first legion was an old one,
which could hardly have received
its standards from Tiberius; while

the twentieth may easily have been ,

levied during his wars: In speech,
moreover, the use of the pronouns

depends more upon the actual posi·

tions of the persons referred to, than

upon their place in the sentence.

The use of the word tirones below

would imply that one of the legions

was newly levied. See also 31. 4,
vernacula multitudo.

7. laeta omnia: he had not s.

heard of the. Pannonian revolt.

includi legatos: the climax— ἶ

centuriones . . . tribunos . . .
legatos—seems to point to rnili-
tary legati.

these words.

But no mention has
been made of any violence against ει
them; while the assault upon Plan· ῗ
cus, a legatus from the senate (39.
