( superbia: ablative of character-
istic. This was an inborn trait of
the Claudian gens. When, how-
ever, Suetonius proceeds (Tib. 2)
to say Claudios omnes . . . optimates
assertoresque unicos dignitatis ac
potentiae patriciorum sem per fuisse,
it may be questioned whether the
tradition is in accordance with his-
torical fact. Mommsen (see Ap-

’ pendix to Vol. Ι. of his Roman

History) shows that this family was
peculiarly free from bondage to
tradition, and was, on the other
hand, prone to innovation3 that

‘- its members were “the predeces-

μ’ sors of the Gracchi and of Caesar.

In this respect the Claudii were

justly called to ascend, in combina-

tion with the Julian house, the im—
perial throne, and even on that

' throne they did not wholly forget
- the traditional policy of their clan;

’ γ, for it is only in the light of this tra-

ditional policy that we can rightly

understand why Tiberius and Clau-

dius declined the title of Imperator,
and various similar traits.''

Rhodi: this city was, until the
time of Claudius, nominally inde—
pendent of Rome. Tiberius was
therefore, during his residence at
Rhodes, legally outside of the bounds
of the empire.

iis . . . annis: B.C. 6 to A.D. 2;
this was in appearance a voluntary
retirement, but as he was not per-
mitted by Augustus to return,-he
was to all intents and purposes an
exile; remansit ergo Rhodi contra
voluntatem (Suet. Tib. 12). The
cause of this retirem'ent is not cer-
tain. Tacitus, chap. 53, attributes
it to the infidelities of his wife Julia,
daughter of Augustus. Suetonius
hints the same, but says that Tibe-
rius himself gave as a reason the
fear of exciting the jealousy of Gaius
and Lucius Caesar3 nibil aliud se-
cessu devitasse se quam aemulatio-
nis cum Gaio Lucioque suspicionem.
Velleius (ΙΙ. 99) gives essentially
the same reason; ne fulgor suus
orientium iuvenum obstaret ini-
tiis. His position at court was cer-
tainly a difficult and embarrassing
one.
