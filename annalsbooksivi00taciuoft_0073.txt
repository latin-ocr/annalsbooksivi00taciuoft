prociderat: this is probably the
incident related by Suetonius (Tib.
27) to illustrate Tiberius' hatred of
flattery: . . . consularem satisfa-
cientem sibi, ac per genua orare
conantem, ita suffugerit, ut caderet
supinus.

14. 2. alii . . . censebant:
neglect of concinnity (Intr. 35 r).

Iuliae filius: an appellation
which in earlier times would have
sounded grotesque in Roman ears.

3. moderandos: so Suetonius
(Tib. 50), admonuit maioribus nec
feminae convenientibus negotiis ab·
stineret. Livia was an intriguing
woman, and, no doubt, like many
modern queen mothers, would have
liked to rule in her son’s name. On
several occasions he gave way to
her5 generally Tiberius showed him-
self firm in repressing such ambition,
velut partes sibi aequas potentiae
vindicantem (Intr. 26 a).

eademque, etc.: this assertion is

evidently sincere3 Tacitus (IV. 37.
2) calls him validus spernendis
honoribus. See Intr. 24, and III.

finitorem z the vestal virgins were
accompanied in public by lictors,
but there were no precedents for
these symbols of empire to accom-
pany a private woman. Livia had,
however, a lictor when officiating as
priestess of Augustus, and after-
wards two lictors were granted by
the Senate to the younger Agrippina
(XIII. 2).

aram adoptionis: z'.e. to com-
memorate her adoption by Augus-
tus3 see 8. 2. Such altars were not
unusual, and implied no personal
sacredness.

4. Germanico Caesari: see 3. 5.

proconsulare imperium: this
was granted by the Senate. Its
possession made him the colleague
of the emperor, and designated him
as successor: see Momm. R'o‘m. St.
