and saw, none of the body-guard, voted his death. After the judgment
. was executed, the body was thrown down the Scalae Ceramiae, and the
rabble abused it for three entire days, and then cast it into the river.l Also
his children were put to death by vote of the senate, the girl—who had
been betrothed to the son of Claudius—being first deflowered by the
executioner, because it was irnpious to execute a virgin in prison. His
wife Apicata² was not condemned to death, but when she had been
informed that her children were dead, and had seen their bodies on the
Gemonian Stairs, she shut herself up in private, wrote out an accusation
against Livilla in regard to the death of Drusus (which had been the
cause of Apicata’s estrangement from her husband, so that they no longer
lived together), sent this to Tiberius, and then put herself to death. And
when Tiberius had received the document and read what was written in it,
he put to death Livilla and all the rest. Ι have heard indeed that he ‘2
spared her in consideration of her mother Antonia, and that Antonia ,on
her own account put her to death by starvation. Δ
12. This however took place at a later time: at present there was · ’
great excitement' in the city. For if the people caught sight of any one
who had had influence with Sejanus, and had been made insolent by this,
they slaughtered him. And the soldiers‚ enraged because they were sus- ⁴ ⁵
pected of devotion to Sejanus (the night-guards being regarded as more
loyal to Tiberius), plundered and burned through the city, although the
chief magistrates undertook to guard the city at the command of Tiberius.
The senate too was disturbed, the partisans of Sejanus being greatly terri· ξ
fied through fear of punishment, and those who had brought accusations
or given evidence against any persons, beginning to suspect that they had
sacrificed them to Sejanus and not to Tiberius. Very few were there who
ventured to take com-age, as not having been mixed up in these things,
and to hope that Tiberius would treat them with mildness. For, as usually
happens, all that had occurred they laid to the account of the man who
had been put to death, and the emperor they blamed very little or not at
all: saying that of most things he had been kept in ignorance, and some
things he had been compelled to do unwillingly. This was the way they
felt in private: in public they voted, as if they were now freed from ’
tyranny‚ that no one should put on mourning for Sejanus, and that a statue ’
of Freedom should be set up in the Forum, and that a feast should be
celebrated by all the magistrates and priests‚—a thing that never happened  χ
before,—and that the day on which he was executed should be celebrated
