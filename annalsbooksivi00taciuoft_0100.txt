auctorem, as being the author.

senatus consulti: the imagined
ordinance in question.
- vexillum: it has been much de-

bated whether this was the vexillum

under which the veterans mentioned Α

above were serving, or the scarlet
banner, χιτὼν κόκκινος, of the com-
mandet, which served as a signal
for battle (quod erat insigne, cum
ad arma concurri oporteret, Caes.

B. G. 11. κο). In favog of its being -

the general's standard is the consid-
eration that it is hard to see why
the other should be in the general's
house, and also the illustration it
would give of the insubordination
of the soldiers, — having possession
of the standard of the commander,
they would perform his functions
for themselves, just as they had
previously directed the posting of
guards, etc. (32. 6). On the other

hand, it is more natural to suppose ,-

that the vexillum is the one pre-

viously mentioned, while the phrase

in domo Germanico situm seems

to imply that it was out of its usual :ss
place; the scarlet vexillum would

be there as a matter of course.
ianuam, the doorway‚· fores,
the door itself.
