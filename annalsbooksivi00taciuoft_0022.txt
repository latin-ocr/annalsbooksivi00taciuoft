tion of facts, although unsound and prejudiced in explaining
them, marks clearly enough (VI. 51) the stages of this deterio-
ration.

14. If we read impartially the account of the treason trials
under Tiberius, it is plain that Libo in the second book, Silanus
in the third, and even Cremutius Cordus and Sabinus in the
fourth, were justly punished3 while in the miserable affair of
Piso the emperor acted with dignity and moderation. But
from the death of Drusus (IV. 8, A.D. 23) we mark a gradual
change 3 the emperor is no less just, and perhaps no less mer-
ciful, but appears suspicious and ungenerous towards the family
of Germanicus (IV. 12), and gradually develops moodiness and
bitterness of temper. This is especially apparent after he was,
made acquainted with the lampoons of Votienus (A.D. 2 5, IV. 42),
which appear to have wounded deeply his proud and sensitive
nature. The breach with Agrippina the next year (IV. 53),

joined with the solicitations of Sejanus, prompted him to with· ,

draw into that sullen seclusion with which his name is most
familiarly associated. But even now, while we cannot aequit
him of undue suspiciousness and cruelty, he cannot, at least
until after the fall of Sejanus, be charged with positive injustice 3
his victims appear to have been guilty, even if their punishment
was excessive. This deterioration of character showed itself
also in other acts. In the early years of his reign he would not
have been a party to the trick by which the condemnation of
Sabinus was secured (IV. 68) 3 his interference with the action
of the senate (VI. 3) is not after the model of his conduct on
assuming the throne (see Ι.’ 2 5) 3 his greediness for gain (VI.
19) is in painful contrast with his earlier freedom from covet-
ousness (ΙΙ. 48 3 III. 18) 3 while his violent and public abuse
of Agrippina and her son Drusus (VI. 25, 24) shows the total
loss of the dignified reticence which had once characterized him.
Even the infamous delator Fulcinius Trio could charge upon
him, fluxam senio mentem (VI. 38), and the words attributed
to Arruntius, cum Tiberius post tantam rerum experientiam vi
